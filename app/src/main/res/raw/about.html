			<h3 p align="center">About us</h3>
			
			<p align="center"> We are two friends who have been studying the course for many years and faced the hurdle of carrying the "Big Blue Book" everywhere. So we decided to make use of the advent of new technologies and create an app that is easy to use. You quickly go to any part of the course: text, lessons or manual, you can search for an word in the course or even set alarms to remind you of to do your lesson. </p><p align="center"> Please support us by spreading the word to your friends and fellow students of the course. Only if enough people buy the app are we able to keep improving it and developing new ones. Thank you.</p>
