<h3><center>- A Course in Miracles -  <br><br>PREFACE <br>TEXT & LESSONS </center></h3> 

<p>
In this confusing world of form, with all it's seeming no-win scencarios of troubles and suffering, it is difficult to imagine a more perfect gift than one that not only promises, but demonstrates the only real solution to the heart's call for help. Yet despite cynicism that 'we can't ever be saved', or that 'it would take a miracle'; we haved been answered beyond belief, through the chanelled healing system of "A Course in Miracles".   
</p>
<p> 
Take time to honestly undertake this magnificent Course and be endlessly rewarded through its loving, dynamic teaching of Truth that heals your life as it heals your mind. Yet the appearance of hard times makes it hard to find the time. Forever practical, this organic natured Course is now responding to modern needs, by inspiring a new form of representation through this helpful application. Perhaps it's to reinforce the message that we are never really alone, and help is always at hand - in fact, right in the palm of your hand.
</p>
<p>  
Once you've studied the Course principles deep enough to realise the immense value of the work, you'll undoubtedly come to appreciate that <b>'the blocks to the awareness of love's presence'</b>, that we must release, are very inconveniently spaced to easily do that. So having the miraculous power & wisdom of the Course on call, directly beside you, is a technological blessing of our times. Here's hoping you find many other unforseen, useful benefits just by having both main parts of the Course together for easy study and referencing.
</p>
<p>
Even for the casual observer, the Course can be real spiritual refreshment, sometimes randomly opened as an oracle, and especially for those who would be still a while and listen to it's words of love. Minds long entrained to fear Love, are realising that this needs correction. A true perception of everything is being offered here in a brand new way. 
</p>
<p>
We are being taught that everything seen with love involves no strain at all, so by way of adding some warm assistance, fresh friendly terms have been given to reflect the kind, constant tone inherent in the Course. Although this great work is entitled 'A Course in Miracles', it could well be called what it's author is asking us to do - <b>'Teach Only Love"</b>. And the Text is displayed under the heading <b>'Return to Love'</b> as a continual reminder of the goal of our miracle path back to Love. Also the Workbook is referred to as <b>'Lessons of Love'</b> for truly they are, and thought of in this way, you might discover they make the perfect companion everywhere you go. 
</p><p>
The intention of the Course is to set you free through transformational miracle mind training in forgiveness. The experiential outcome of this is to prove to each one of us that "You are the Light of the World." This is an extremely light message, interestingly delivered from a heavyweight book, but it's imperative that we desire to understand it with a welcoming heart. Frequent reminders, interwoven with everyday communication, might just be the way for us to really accept and integrate this deeply. Yes, we surely are being encouraged to decide to see all things differently, and so this is why the menu screen emphatically reminds us, as the Course does, to <b>'Choose Again'.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE COURSE, please be encouraged.</b> You have actually struck spiritual gold and not by accident. Give yourself a chance and don't let the terminology used, or your own double guessing, or anything put you off; because you will look at everything differently as you go along. You will see. It doesn't matter what you believe about the meaning and reality of life and your place and purpose in it, "A Course in Miracles" has been given to meet you exactly where you are. 
</p>
<p>
It really is about miracles and it is about you working them. What needs to be understood however, is that a miracle is a correction of your mind which literally brings about the only healing there is...ever. When your mind is healed, your world is healed. The Course is a call to you wherever you go to perform this function, which is your only purpose in the world. In the 'Urtext', (the original version of the Course), we're told, <br><br><i>"You will see miracles through your hands through me. You should begin each day with the prayer - <br><b>'Help me to perform whatever miracles you want of me today'</b>." </i><br><br>This is a mighty calling  and if you are reading this, no matter what you think of yourself, you are ready, worthy and enough to answer it. And when you do you will see for yourself all the proof you need, for you will be changed for good...and you will love it!...because you are returning to your true nature.
</p>
<p>
So when you are guided, and if you are decided to do the workbook of the Course, <b>it is important to read the succinct INTRODUCTION to the lessons before you begin.</b> You will find this <b>at the start of lesson one,</b> directly as you open to it.  In fact, because it is very concise it's a good idea to read it three times. Of course you will understand it the first time but this sacred undertaking will take at least a year and essentially you will be on Course until you realise your home in Heaven. Nothing is missing in this Course that you need, and nothing added that you don't. Take your time, read and do what it says; it's for you, the real, divine you. It is a way in Truth that will set you free and return you to Peace eternal - your natural inheritance.

<p>
Thank you for purchasing this app. The design is meant to feel relaxed and peaceful, yet give you ready, easy access to the main study material of ACIM, namely the Text and Workbook. Even though you are likely to find the layout fairly straight forward, here are some guidelines that might help you.
</p>
<p>
<center><b>The 'LESSONS OF LOVE' Screen</center></b>
</p>
<p>
The <b>Workbook for Students</b> is the main part of the actual mind training of A Course in Miracles, essential to the goal of the healing curriculum, and foremost in the 365 lessons of love exercises that are accessed from this screen. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1) 'TODAY'S LESSON' </b>- Here set your LESSON FOR THE DAY in the <b>numerical input box and then tap OK</b> to bring up the lesson. By default it is set at lesson 1 to begin.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This box is always viable and can be easily changed if you need. However if you <b>set it and forget it</b>, each day will automatically advance from the number set to the next lesson at midnight <b>provided you have done your lesson for that day.</b> Otherwise the lesson is waiting for you to do it. <b>Simply click OK whenever you want to go to your lesson.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>2) 'SELECT LESSON' -  Use this box to select SPECIFIC LESSON.</b> At times you might want to read a particular lesson without upsetting your daily lesson. Just type in a value <b>between 1 and 365 and press the GO button</b> to bring up that lesson.
</p>
<p>
<b>3) SCREEN SCROLLS</b> - up and down smoothly for each lesson if it is needed.
</p>
<p>
<b>4) TO ACCESS OTHER LESSONS - just flick sideways</b>, to quickly access lessons either forward or back in sequence .
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Take care when viewing a lesson - <b>don't flick when scrolling up and down.</b> Instead slide with your finger gently pressed against the screen, or make your slide longer than just a flick. This will ensure you stay on the lesson you are reading. 
</p>
<p>
<b>5) TO ZOOM IN AND ZOOM OUT - use the +/- button</b> that will appear in the bottom right corner when you slide or touch the screen slightly. Using this button will ensure the best text layout on the screen. You can also use two fingers in a pinching manner for bigger or smaller text but this might mean you lose your place. 
</p>
<p>
A little experimentation with all these controls should give you a pleasing result.

</p>
<p>
<center><b>The 'RETURN TO LOVE' Screen</center></b>
</p>
<p>
The <b>Text</b> of A Course in Miracles explains the time/space situation, special relationships and misunderstandings we are faced with in our conditioned world experience we call life, and then gives directives as to our best path of response to find ultimate salvation and true home in Love. Students often elect to study this concurrently as they do the lessons. There's no set approach for the text. It's up to you. This loving guidance is accessed from this screen. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1) SELECT CHAPTER - Tap this horizontal bar</b> to open up a dropdown screen with 31 Chapters listed. Scroll through this list and tap on the chapter you choose to select it. A second horizontal bar will appear.
</p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Buttons highlight when tapped to indicate they are activated.
<p>
<b>2) SELECT SECTION</b> - Tap this <b>second horizontal bar</b> to open a dropdown screen with the sections for the current chapter listed. Scroll the list and tap the section you want to select it. 
</p>
<p>
<b>3) CHAPTER AND SECTION - are now displayed together</b> on the two bars for your review. Change them if you like or proceed to the text by touching the GO button to bring up your selection. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Any section in a chapter can access the rest of that chapter by scrolling up or down. But <b>to access another chapter</b> you need to use the back button on your phone and reselect from the 'RETURN TO LOVE' screen. Also note that if your phone is set for rotation, landscape or portrait orientation is supported for both Text and Lessons.
