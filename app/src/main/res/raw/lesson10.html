			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 10</h3>    <p align="center"><b>My thoughts do not mean anything. </b></p><p> This idea applies to all the thoughts of which you are aware, or become aware     in the practice periods. The reason the idea is applicable to all of them     is that they are not your real thoughts. We have made this distinction before,     and will do so again. You have no basis for comparison as yet. When you     do, you will have no doubt that what you once believed were your thoughts     did not mean anything. </p><p> This is the second time we have used this kind of idea. The form is only     slightly different. This time the idea is introduced with "My thoughts" instead     of "These thoughts," and no link is made overtly with the things     around you. The emphasis is now on the lack of reality of what you think     you think. </p><p> This aspect of the correction process began with the idea that the thoughts     of which you are aware are meaningless, outside rather than within; and     then stressed their past rather than their present status. Now we are emphasizing     that the presence of these "thoughts" means that you are not thinking.     This is merely another way of repeating our earlier statement that your     mind is really a blank. To recognize this is to recognize nothingness when     you think you see it. As such, it is the prerequisite for vision. </p><p> Close your eyes for these exercises, and introduce them by repeating the     idea for today quite slowly to yourself. Then add: </p>     <p align="center"><i>This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe. </i></p><p> The exercises consist, as before, in searching your mind for all the thoughts     that are available to you, without selection or judgment.  Try to avoid     classification of any kind.  In fact, if you find it helpful to do so,     you might imagine that you are watching an oddly assorted procession going     by, which has little if any personal meaning to you.  As each one crosses     your mind, say: </p>     <p align="center"><i>My thought about ___ does not mean anything.<br />     </i><i>My thought about ___ does not mean anything. </i></p><p> Today's thought can obviously serve for any thought that distresses you at     any time.  In addition, five practice periods are recommended, each involving     no more than a minute or so of mind searching.  It is not recommended that     this time period be extended, and it should be reduced to half a minute     or less if you experience discomfort.  Remember, however, to repeat the     idea slowly before applying it specifically, and also to add: </p>     <p align="center"><i>This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
