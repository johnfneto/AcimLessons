You may think it buys you something, and may still     believe a little that it buys you what you want. Yet this belief is surely     shaken now, at least enough to let you question it, and to suspect it really     makes no sense. It has not gone as yet, but lacks the roots that once secured     it tightly to the dark and hidden secret places of your mind. </p><p> Today we try to loose its weakened hold still further, and to realize that     pain is purposeless, without a cause and with no power to accomplish anything.     It cannot purchase anything at all. It offers nothing, and does not exist.     And everything you think it offers you is lacking in existence, like itself.     You have been slave to nothing. Be you free today to join the happy Will     of God. </p><p> For several days we will continue to devote our periods of practicing to     exercises planned to help you reach the happiness God's Will has placed     in you. Here is your home, and here your safety is. Here is your peace,     and here there is no fear. Here is salvation. Here is rest at last. </p><p> Begin your practice periods today with this acceptance of God's Will for     you: </p>     <p align="center"><i>I share God's Will for happiness for me, and <br />     I accept it as my function now. </i></p><p>Then seek this function deep within your mind, for it is there, awaiting but     your choice. You cannot fail to find it when you learn it is your choice,     and that you share God's Will. </p><p> Be happy, for your only function here is happiness. You have no need to be     less loving to God's Son than He Whose Love created him as loving as Himself.     Besides these hourly five-minute rests, pause frequently today, to tell     yourself that you have now accepted happiness as your one function. And     be sure that you are joining with God's Will in doing this.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
