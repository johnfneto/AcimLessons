It cannot be apart from it. Nor can it     be experienced where love is not. Love has no limits, being everywhere.     And therefore joy is everywhere as well. Yet can the mind deny that this     is so, believing there are gaps in love where sin can enter, bringing pain     instead of joy. This strange belief would limit happiness by redefining     love as limited, and introducing opposition in what has no limit and no     opposite. </p><p> Fear is associated then with love, and its results become the heritage of     minds that think what they have made is real. These images, with no reality     in truth, bear witness to the fear of God, forgetting being Love, He must     be joy. This basic error we will try again to bring to truth today, and     teach ourselves: </p>     <p align="center"><i>God, being Love, is also happiness.<br />     </i><i>To fear Him is to be afraid of joy. </i></p><p>Begin your periods of practicing today with this association, which corrects     the false belief that God is fear. It also emphasizes happiness belongs     to you, because of what He is. </p><p> Allow this one correction to be placed within your mind each waking hour     today. Then welcome all the happiness it brings as truth replaces fear,     and joy becomes what you expect to take the place of pain. God, being Love,     it will be given you. Bolster this expectation frequently throughout the     day, and quiet all your fears with this assurance, kind and wholly true: </p>     <p align="center"><i>God, being Love, is also happiness.<br />          And it is happiness I     seek today.<br />     I cannot fail, because I seek the truth.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
