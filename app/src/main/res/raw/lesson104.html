They are your right, because of what you are. They come to you from     God, Who cannot fail to give you what He wills. Yet must there be a place     made ready to receive His gifts. They are not welcomed gladly by a mind     that has instead nreceived the gifts it made where His belong, as substitutes     for them. </p><p> Today we would remove all meaningless and self-made gifts which we have placed     upon the holy altar where God's gifts belong. His are the gifts that are     our own in truth. His are the gifts that we inherited before time was, and     that will still be ours when time has passed into eternity. His are the     gifts that are within us now, for they are timeless. And we need not wait     to have them. They belong to us today. </p><p> Therefore, we choose to have them now, and know, in choosing them in place     of what we made, we but unite our will with what God wills, and recognize     the same as being one. Our longer practice periods today, the hourly five     minutes given truth for your salvation, should begin with this: </p>     <p><i>I seek but what belongs to me in truth, <br />     And joy and peace are my inheritance. </i></p><p>Then lay aside the conflicts of the world that offer other gifts and other     goals made of illusions, witnessed to by them, and sought for only in a     world of dreams. </p><p> All this we lay aside, and seek instead that which is truly ours, as we ask     to recognize what God has given us. We clear a holy place within our minds     before His altar, where His gifts of peace and joy are welcome, and to which     we come to find what has been given us by Him. We come in confidence today,     aware that what belongs to us in truth is what He gives. And we would wish     for nothing else, for nothing else belongs to us in truth. </p><p> So do we clear the way for Him today by simply recognizing that His Will     is done already, and that joy and peace belong to us as His eternal gifts.     We will not let ourselves lose sight of them between the times we come to     seek for them where He has laid them. This reminder will we bring to mind     as often as we can: </p>     <p><i>I seek but what belongs to me in truth.<br />     </i><i>God's gifts of joy and peace are all I want.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
