Be still today and listen to the truth. Be not deceived     by voices of the dead, which tell you they have found the source of life     and offer it to you for your belief. Attend them not, but listen to the     truth. </p><p> Be not afraid today to circumvent the voices of the world. Walk lightly past     their meaningless persuasion. Hear them not. Be still today and listen to     the truth. Go past all things which do not speak of Him Who holds your happiness     within His Hand, held out to you in welcome and in love. Hear only Him today,     and do not wait to reach Him longer. Hear one Voice today. </p><p> Today the promise of God's Word is kept. Hear and be silent. He would speak     to you. He comes with miracles a thousand times as happy and as wonderful     as those you ever dreamed or wished for in your dreams. His miracles are     true. They will not fade when dreaming ends. They end the dream instead;     and last forever, for they come from God to His dear Son, whose other name     is you. Prepare yourself for miracles today. Today allow your Father's ancient     pledge to you and all your brothers to be kept. </p><p> Hear Him today, and listen to the Word which lifts the veil that lies upon     the earth, and wakes all those who sleep and cannot see. God calls to them     through you. He needs your voice to speak to them, for who could reach God's     Son except his Father, calling through your Self? Hear Him today, and offer     Him your voice to speak to all the multitude who wait to hear the Word that     He will speak today. </p><p> Be ready for salvation. It is here, and will today be given unto you. And     you will learn your function from the One Who chose it in your Father's     Name for you. Listen today, and you will hear a Voice which will resound     throughout the world through you. The bringer of all miracles has need that     you receive them first, and thus become the joyous giver of what you received. </p><p> Thus does salvation start and thus it ends; when everything is yours and     everything is given away, it will remain with you forever. And the lesson     has been learned. Today we practice giving, not the way you understand it     now, but as it is. Each hour's exercises should begin with this request     for your enlightenment: </p>     <p><i>I will be still and listen to the truth.<br />     </i><i>What does it mean to give and to receive? </i></p><p> Ask and expect an answer. Your request is one whose answer has been waiting     long to be received by you. It will begin the ministry for which you came,     and which will free the world from thinking giving is a way to lose. And     so the world becomes ready to understand and to receive. </p><p> Be still and listen to the truth today. For each five minutes spent in listening,     a thousand minds are opened to the truth and they will hear the holy Word     you hear. And when the hour is past, you will again release a thousand more     who pause to ask that truth be given them, along with you. </p><p> Today the holy Word of God is kept through your receiving it to give away,     so you can teach the world what giving means by listening and learning it     of Him. Do not forget today to reinforce your choice to hear and to receive     the Word by this reminder, given to yourself as often as is possible today: </p>     <p><i>Let me be still and listen to the truth.<br />     </i><i>I am the messenger of God today,<br />     </i><i>My voice is His, to give what I receive. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
