The light is in it, for it reconciles all     seeming opposites. And what is light except the resolution, born of peace,     of all your conflicts and mistaken thoughts into one concept which is wholly     true? Even that one will disappear, because the Thought behind it will appear     instead to take its place. And now you are at peace forever, for the dream     is over then. </p><p> True light that makes true vision possible is not the light the body's eyes     behold. It is a state of mind that has become so unified that darkness cannot     be perceived at all. And thus what is the same is seen as one, while what     is not the same remains unnoticed, for it is not there. </p><p> This is the light that shows no opposites, and vision, being healed, has     power to heal. This is the light that brings your peace of mind to other     minds, to share it and be glad that they are one with you and with themselves.     This is the light that heals because it brings single perception, based     upon one frame of reference, from which one meaning comes. </p><p> Here are both giving and receiving seen as different aspects of one Thought     whose truth does not depend on which is seen as first, nor which appears     to be in second place. Here it is understood that both occur together, that     the Thought remain complete. And in this understanding is the base on which     all opposites are reconciled, because they are perceived from the same frame     of reference which unifies this Thought. </p><p> One thought, completely unified, will serve to unify all thought. This is     the same as saying one correction will suffice for all correction, or that     to forgive one brother wholly is enough to bring salvation to all minds.     For these are but some special cases of one law which holds for every kind     of learning, if it be directed by the One Who knows the truth. </p><p> To learn that giving and receiving are the same has special usefulness, because     it can be tried so easily and seen as true. And when this special case has     proved it always works, in every circumstance where it is tried, the thought     behind it can be generalized to other areas of doubt and double vision.     And from there it will extend, and finally arrive at the one Thought which     underlies them all. </p><p> Today we practice with the special case of giving and receiving. We will     use this simple lesson in the obvious because it has results we cannot miss.     To give is to receive. Today we will attempt to offer peace to everyone,     and see how quickly peace returns to us. Light is tranquility, and in that     peace is vision given us, and we can see. </p><p> So we begin the practice periods with the instruction for today, and say: </p>     <p><i>To give and to receive are one in truth.<br />     I will receive what I am giving now. </i></p><p>Then close your eyes, and for five minutes think of what you would hold out     to everyone, to have it yours. You might, for instance, say: </p>     <p><i>To everyone I offer quietness.<br />     </i><i>To everyone I offer peace of mind.<br />     </i><i>To everyone I offer gentleness. </i></p><p> Say each one slowly and then pause a while, expecting to receive the gift     you gave. And it will come to you in the amount in which you gave it. You     will find you have exact return, for that is what you asked. It might be     helpful, too, to think of one to whom to give your gifts. He represents     the others, and through him you give to all. </p><p> Our very simple lesson for today will teach you much. Effect and cause will     be far better understood from this time on, and we will make much faster     progress now. Think of the exercises for today as quick advances in your     learning, made still faster and more sure each time you say, "To give     and to receive are one in truth." </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
