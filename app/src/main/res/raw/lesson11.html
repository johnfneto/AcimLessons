			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 11</h3>    <p align="center"><b>My meaningless thoughts are showing me a meaningless     world. </b></p><p> This is the first idea we have had that is related to a major phase of the     correction process; the reversal of the thinking of the world. It seems     as if the world determines what you perceive. Today's idea introduces the     concept that your thoughts determine the world you see. Be glad indeed to     practice the idea in its initial form, for in this idea is your release     made sure. The key to forgiveness lies in it. </p><p> The practice periods for today's idea are to be undertaken somewhat differently     from the previous ones. Begin with your eyes closed, and repeat the idea     slowly to yourself. Then open your eyes and look about, near and far, up     and down, &mdash;anywhere. During the minute or so to be spent in using the     idea merely repeat it to yourself, being sure to do so without haste, and     with no sense of urgency or effort. </p><p> To do these exercises for maximum benefit, the eyes should move from one     thing to another fairly rapidly, since they should not linger on anything     in particular. The words, however, should be used in an unhurried, even     leisurely fashion. The introduction to this idea, in particular, should     be practiced as casually as possible. It contains the foundation for the     peace, relaxation and freedom from worry that we are trying to achieve.     On concluding the exercises, close your eyes and repeat the idea once more     slowly to yourself. </p><p> Three practice periods today will probably be sufficient. However, if there     is little or no uneasiness and an inclination to do more, as many as five     may be undertaken. More than this is not recommended. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
