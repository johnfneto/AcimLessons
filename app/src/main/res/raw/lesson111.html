We will review two recent     lessons every day for ten successive days of practicing. We will observe     a special format for these practice periods, that you are urged to follow     just as closely as you can.</p><p>We understand, of course, that it may be impossible for     you to undertake what is suggested here as optimal each day and every hour     of the day. Learning will not be hampered when you miss a practice period     because it is impossible at the appointed time. Nor is it necessary that     you make excessive efforts to be sure that you catch up in terms of numbers.     Rituals are not our aim, and would defeat our goal.</p><p>But learning will be hampered when you skip a practice     period because you are unwilling to devote the time to it that you are asked     to give. Do not deceive yourself in this. Unwillingness can be most carefully     concealed behind a cloak of situations you cannot control. Learn to distinguish     situations that are poorly suited to your practicing from those that you     establish to uphold a camouflage for your unwillingness.</p><p>Those practice periods that you have lost because you     did not want to do them, for whatever reason, should be done as soon as     you have changed your mind about your goal. You are unwilling to cooperate     in practicing salvation only if it interferes with goals you hold more dear.     When you withdraw the value given them, allow your practice periods to be     replacements for your litanies to them. They gave you nothing. But your     practicing can offer everything to you. And so accept their offering and     be at peace.</p><p>The format you should use for these reviews is this: Devote     five minutes twice a day, or longer if you would prefer it, to considering     the thoughts that are assigned. Read over the ideas and comments that are     written down for each day's exercise. And then begin to think about them,     while letting your mind relate them to your needs, your seeming problems     and all your concerns.</p><p>Place the ideas within your mind, and let it use them as it     chooses. Give it faith that it will use them wisely, being helped in its     decisions by the One Who gave the thoughts to you. What can you trust but     what is in your mind? Have faith, in these reviews, the means the Holy Spirit     uses will not fail. The wisdom of your mind will come to your assistance.     Give direction at the outset; then lean back in quiet faith, and let the     mind employ the thoughts you gave as they were given you for it to use. </p><p>You have been given them in perfect trust; in perfect confidence that you     would use them well; in perfect faith that you would see their messages     and use them for yourself. Offer them to your mind in that same trust and     confidence and faith. It will not fail. It is the Holy Spirit's chosen means     for your salvation. Since it has His trust, His means must surely merit     yours as well.</p><p>We emphasize the benefits to you if you devote the first five minutes of     the day to your reviews, and also give the last five minutes of your waking     day to them. If this cannot be done, at least try to divide them so you     undertake one in the morning, and the other in the hour just before you     go to sleep.</p><p>The exercises to be done throughout the day are equally important, and     perhaps of even greater value. You have been inclined to practice only at     appointed times, and then go on your way to other things, without applying     what you learned to them. As a result, you have gained little reinforcement,     and have not given your learning a fair chance to prove how great are its     potential gifts to you. Here is another chance to use it well. </p><p>In these reviews, we stress the need to let your learning not lie idly     by between your longer practice periods. Attempt to give your daily two     ideas a brief but serious review each hour. Use one on the hour, and the     other one a half an hour later. You need not give more than just a moment     to each one. Repeat it, and allow your mind to rest a little time in silence     and in peace. Then turn to other things, but try to keep the thought with     you, and let it serve to help you keep your peace throughout the day as     well.</p><p>If you are shaken, think of it again. These practice periods are planned     to help you form the habit of applying what you learn each day to everything     you do.&nbsp; not repeat the thought and lay it down. Its usefulness is     limitless to you. And it is meant to serve you in all ways, all times and     places, and whenever you need help of any kind. Try, then, to take it with     you in the business of the day and make it holy, worthy of God's Son, acceptable     to God and to your Self.</p><p>Each day's review assignments will conclude with a restatement of the     thought to use each hour, and the one to be applied on each half hour as     well. Forget them not. This second chance with each of these ideas will     bring such large advances that we come from these reviews with learning     gains so great we will continue on more solid ground, with firmer footsteps     and with stronger faith.</p>     <p>Do not forget how little you have learned. <br />          Do not forget how much you can learn now. <br />          Do not forget your Father's need of you,&nbsp; <br />          As you review these thoughts He gave to you.</p><hr /><p align="center"><b>Lesson 111</b></p><p align="center">For morning and evening review: </p><p><b>(91) Miracles are seen in light. </b></p>     <p><i>I cannot see in darkness.<br /> Let the light of holiness and           truth light up my          mind, and let me see the innocence           within. </i></p><p><b>(92) Miracles are seen in light, and light and strength are one. </b></p>     <p><i>I see through strength, the gift of God to me. <br />          My weakness is the dark His          gift dispels, by giving           me His strength to take its place. </i></p>     <p>	On the hour: </p>               <p><b>Miracles are seen in light. </b></p>          <p> On the half hour:</p>               <p><b>Miracles are seen in light, and light and strength               are one.</b> </p>     <p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
