Our home is safe,     protection guaranteed in all we do, power and strength available to us in     all our undertakings. We can fail in nothing. Everything we touch takes     on a shining light that blesses and that heals. At one with God and with     the universe we go our way rejoicing, with the thought that God Himself     goes everywhere with us. </p><p> How holy are our minds! And everything we see reflects the holiness within     the mind at one with God and with itself. How easily do errors disappear,     and death give place to everlasting life. Our shining footprints point the     way to truth, for God is our Companion as we walk the world a little while.     And those who come to follow us will recognize the way because the light     we carry stays behind, yet still remains with us as we walk on. </p><p> What we receive is our eternal gift to those who follow after, and to those     who went before or stayed with us a while. And God, Who loves us with the     equal love in which we were created, smiles on us and offers us the happiness     we gave. </p><p> Today we will not doubt His Love for us, nor question His protection and     His care. No meaningless anxieties can come between our faith and our awareness     of His Presence. We are one with Him today in recognition and remembrance.     We feel Him in our hearts. Our minds contain His Thoughts; our eyes behold     His loveliness in all we look upon. Today we see only the loving and the     lovable. </p><p> We see it in appearances of pain, and pain gives way to peace. We see it     in the frantic, in the sad and the distressed, the lonely and afraid, who     are restored to the tranquility and peace of mind in which they were created.     And we see it in the dying and the dead as well, restoring them to life.     All this we see because we saw it first within ourselves. </p><p> No miracle can ever be denied to those who know that they are one with God.     No thought of theirs but has the power to heal all forms of suffering in     anyone, in times gone by and times as yet to come, as easily as in the ones     who walk beside them now. Their thoughts are timeless, and apart from distance     as apart from time. </p><p> We join in this awareness as we say that we are one with God. For in these     words we say as well that we are saved and healed; that we can save and     heal accordingly. We have accepted, and we now would give. For we would     keep the gifts our Father gave. Today we would experience ourselves at one     with Him, so that the world may share our recognition of reality. In our     experience the world is freed. As we deny our separation from our Father,     it is healed along with us. </p><p> Peace be to you today. Secure your peace by practicing awareness you are     one with your Creator, as He is with you. Sometime today, whenever it seems     best, devote a half an hour to the thought that you are one with God. This     is our first attempt at an extended period for which we give no rules nor     special words to guide your meditation. We will trust God's Voice to speak     as He sees fit today, certain He will not fail. Abide with Him this half     an hour. He will do the rest. </p><p> Your benefit will not be less if you believe that nothing happens. You may     not be ready to accept the gain today. Yet sometime, somewhere, it will     come to you, nor will you fail to recognize it when it dawns with certainty     upon your mind. This half an hour will be framed in gold, with every minute     like a diamond set around the mirror that this exercise will offer you.     And you will see Christ's face upon it, in reflection of your own. </p><p> Perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, you will see your own transfiguration in     the glass this holy half an hour will hold out to you, to look upon yourself.     When you are ready you will find it there, within your mind and waiting     to be found. You will remember then the thought to which you gave this half     an hour, thankfully aware no time was ever better spent. </p><p> Perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, you will look into this glass, and understand     the sinless light you see belongs to you; the loveliness you look on is     your own. Count this half hour as your gift to God, in certainty that His     return will be a sense of love you cannot understand, a joy too deep for     you to comprehend, a sight too holy for the body's eyes to see. And yet     you can be sure someday, perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, you will understand     and comprehend and see. </p><p> Add further jewels to the golden frame that holds the mirror offered you     today, by hourly repeating to yourself: </p>     <p><i>Let me remember I am one with God, at one with all my           brothers and my Self,          in everlasting holiness and peace. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
