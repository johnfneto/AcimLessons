Perhaps you     think there is a kind of love for this, a kind for that; a way of loving     one, another way of loving still another. Love is one. It has no separate     parts and no degrees; no kinds nor levels, no divergencies and no distinctions.     It is like itself, unchanged throughout. It never alters with a person or     a circumstance. It is the Heart of God, and also of His Son. </p><p> Love's meaning is obscure to anyone who thinks that love can change. He does     not see that changing love must be impossible. And thus he thinks that he     can love at times, and hate at other times. He also thinks that love can     be bestowed on one, and yet remain itself although it is withheld from others.     To believe these things of love is not to understand it. If it could make     such distinctions, it would have to judge between the righteous and the     sinner, and perceive the Son of God in separate parts. </p><p> Love cannot judge. As it is one itself, it looks on all as one. Its meaning     lies in oneness. And it must elude the mind that thinks of it as partial     or in part. There is no love but God's, and all of love is His. There is     no other principle that rules where love is not. Love is a law without an     opposite. Its wholeness is the power holding everything as one, the link     between the Father and the Son which holds Them both forever as the same. </p><p> No course whose purpose is to teach you to remember what you really are could     fail to emphasize that there can never be a difference in what you really     are and what love is. Love's meaning is your own, and shared by God Himself.     For what you are is what He is. There is no love but His, and what He is,     is everything there is. There is no limit placed upon Himself, and so are     you unlimited as well. </p><p> No law the world obeys can help you grasp love's meaning. What the world     believes was made to hide love's meaning, and to keep it dark and secret.     There is not one principle the world upholds but violates the truth of what     love is, and what you are as well. </p><p> Seek not within the world to find your Self. Love is not found in darkness     and in death. Yet it is perfectly apparent to the eyes that see and ears     that hear love's Voice. Today we practice making free your mind of all the     laws you think you must obey; of all the limits under which you live, and     all the changes that you think are part of human destiny. Today we take     the largest single step this course requests in your advance towards its     established goal. </p><p> If you achieve the faintest glimmering of what love means today, you have     advanced in distance without measure and in time beyond the count of years     to your release. Let us together, then, be glad to give some time to God     today, and understand there is no better use for time than this. </p><p> For fifteen minutes twice today escape from every law in which you now believe.     Open your mind and rest. The world that seems to hold you prisoner can be     escaped by anyone who does not hold it dear. Withdraw all value you have     placed upon its meager offerings and senseless gifts, and let the gift of     God replace them all. </p><p> Call to your Father, certain that His Voice will answer. He Himself has promised     this. And He Himself will place a spark of truth within your mind wherever     you give up a false belief, a dark illusion of your own reality and what     love means. He will shine through your idle thoughts today, and help you     understand the truth of love. In loving gentleness He will abide with you,     as you allow His Voice to teach love's meaning to your clean and open mind.     And He will bless the lesson with His Love. </p><p> Today the legion of the future years of waiting for salvation disappears     before the timelessness of what you learn. Let us give thanks today that     we are spared a future like the past. Today we leave the past behind us,     nevermore to be remembered. And we raise our eyes upon a different present,     where a future dawns unlike the past in every attribute. </p><p> The world in infancy is newly born. And we will watch it grow in health and     strength, to shed its blessing upon all who come to learn to cast aside     the world they thought was made in hate to be love's enemy. Now are they     all made free, along with us. Now are they all our brothers in God's Love. </p><p> We will remember them throughout the day, because we cannot leave a part     of us outside our love if we would know our Self. At least three times an     hour think of one who makes the journey with you, and who came to learn     what you must learn. And as he comes to mind, give him this message from     your Self: </p>     <p><i>I bless you, brother, with the Love of God, which I would           share with you.         <br /> For I would learn the joyous lesson that           there is no love but God's and          yours and mine and everyone's. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
