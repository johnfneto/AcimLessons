You     cannot stop with the idea the world is worthless, for unless you see that     there is something else to hope for, you will only be depressed. Our emphasis     is not on giving up the world, but on exchanging it for what is far more     satisfying, filled with joy, and capable of offering you peace. Think you     this world can offer that to you? </p><p> It might be worth a little time to think once more about the value of this     world. Perhaps you will concede there is no loss in letting go all thought     of value here. The world you see is merciless indeed, unstable, cruel, unconcerned     with you, quick to avenge and pitiless with hate. It gives but to rescind,     and takes away all things that you have cherished for a while. No lasting     love is found, for none is here. This is the world of time, where all things     end. </p><p> Is it a loss to find a world instead where losing is impossible; where love     endures forever, hate cannot exist and vengeance has no meaning? Is it loss     to find all things you really want, and know they have no ending and they     will remain exactly as you want them throughout time? Yet even they will     be exchanged at last for what we cannot speak of, for you go from there     to where words fail entirely, into a silence where the language is unspoken     and yet surely understood. </p><p> Communication, unambiguous and plain as day, remains unlimited for all eternity.     And God Himself speaks to His Son, as His Son speaks to Him. Their language     has no words, for what They say cannot be symbolized. Their knowledge is     direct and wholly shared and wholly one. How far away from this are you     who stay bound to this world. And yet how near are you, when you exchange     it for the world you want. </p><p> Now is the last step certain; now you stand an instant's space away from     timelessness. Here can you but look forward, never back to see again the     world you do not want. Here is the world that comes to take its place, as     you unbind your mind from little things the world sets forth to keep you     prisoner. Value them not, and they will disappear. Esteem them, and they     will seem real to you. </p><p> Such is the choice. What loss can be for you in choosing not to value nothingness?     This world holds nothing that you really want, but what you choose instead     you want indeed! Let it be given you today. It waits but for your choosing     it, to take the place of all the things you seek but do not want. </p><p> Practice your willingness to make this change ten minutes in the morning     and at night, and once more in between. Begin with this: </p>     <p><i>Beyond this world there is a world I want. <br />          I choose to see that world instead          of this,           for here is nothing that I really want. </i></p><p>Then close your eyes upon the world you see, and in the silent darkness watch     the lights that are not of this world light one by one, until where one     begins another ends loses all meaning as they blend in one. </p><p> Today the lights of Heaven bend to you, to shine upon your eyelids as you     rest beyond the world of darkness. Here is light your eyes can not behold.     And yet your mind can see it plainly, and can understand. A day of grace     is given you today, and we give thanks. This day we realize that what you     feared to lose was only loss. </p><p> Now do we understand there is no loss. For we have seen its opposite at last,     and we are grateful that the choice is made. Remember your decision hourly,     and take a moment to confirm your choice by laying by whatever thoughts     you have, and dwelling briefly only upon this: </p>     <p><i>The world I see holds nothing that I want. <br />          Beyond this world there is a world          I want. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
