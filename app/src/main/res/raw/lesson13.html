			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 13</h3>    <p align="center"><b>A meaningless world engenders fear. </b></p><p> Today's idea is really another form of the preceding one, except that it     is more specific as to the emotion aroused. Actually, a meaningless world     is impossible. Nothing without meaning exists. However, it does not follow     that you will not think you perceive something that has no meaning. On the     contrary, you will be particularly likely to think you do perceive it. </p><p> Recognition of meaninglessness arouses intense anxiety in all the separated     ones. It represents a situation in which God and the ego "challenge" each     other as to whose meaning is to be written in the empty space that meaninglessness     provides. The ego rushes in frantically to establish its own ideas there,     fearful that the void may otherwise be used to demonstrate its own impotence     and unreality. And on this alone it is correct. </p><p> It is essential, therefore, that you learn to recognize the meaningless,     and accept it without fear. If you are fearful, it is certain that you will     endow the world with attributes that it does not possess, and crowd it with     images that do not exist. To the ego illusions are safety devices, as they     must also be to you who equate yourself with the ego. </p><p> The exercises for today, which should be done about three or four times for     not more than a minute or so at most each time, are to be practiced in a     somewhat different way from the preceding ones. With eyes closed, repeat     today's idea to yourself. Then open your eyes, and look about you slowly,     saying: </p>     <p><i>I am looking at a meaningless world. </i></p><p>Repeat this statement to yourself as you look about. Then close your eyes,     and conclude with: </p>     <p><i>A meaningless world engenders fear because I think I am in competition with          God. </i></p><p> You may find it difficult to avoid resistance, in one form or another, to     this concluding statement. Whatever form such resistance may take, remind     yourself that you are really afraid of such a thought because of the "vengeance" of     the "enemy." You are not expected to believe the statement at     this point, and will probably dismiss it as preposterous. Note carefully,     however, any signs of overt or covert fear which it may arouse. </p><p> This is our first attempt at stating an explicit cause and effect relationship     of a kind which you are very inexperienced in recognizing. Do not dwell     on the concluding statement, and try not even to think of it except during     the practice periods. That will suffice at present.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
