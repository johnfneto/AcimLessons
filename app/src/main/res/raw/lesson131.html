You look for permanence in the impermanent, for love where there is none,     for safety in the midst of danger; immortality within the darkness of the     dream of death. Who could succeed where contradiction is the setting of     his searching, and the place to which he comes to find stability? </p><p> Goals that are meaningless are not attained. There is no way to reach them,     for the means by which you strive for them are meaningless as they are.     Who can use such senseless means, and hope through them to gain in anything?     Where can they lead? And what could they achieve that offers any hope of     being real? Pursuit of the imagined leads to death because it is the search     for nothingness, and while you seek for life you ask for death. You look     for safety and security, while in your heart you pray for danger and protection     for the little dream you made. </p><p> Yet searching is inevitable here. For this you came, and you will surely     do the thing you came for. But the world can not dictate the goal for which     you search, unless you give it power to do so. Otherwise, you still are     free to choose a goal that lies beyond the world and every worldly thought,     and one that comes to you from an idea relinquished yet remembered, old     yet new; an echo of a heritage forgot, yet holding everything you really     want. </p><p> Be glad that search you must. Be glad as well to learn you search for Heaven,     and must find the goal you really want. No one can fail to want this goal     and reach it in the end. God's Son can not seek vainly, though he try to     force delay, deceive himself and think that it is hell he seeks. When he     is wrong, he finds correction. When he wanders off, he is led back to his     appointed task. </p><p> No one remains in hell, for no one can abandon his Creator, nor affect His     perfect, timeless and unchanging Love. You will find Heaven. Everything     you seek but this will fall away. Yet not because it has been taken from     you. It will go because you do not want it. You will reach the goal you     really want as certainly as God created you in sinlessness. </p><p> Why wait for Heaven? It is here today. Time is the great illusion it is past     or in the future. Yet this cannot be, if it is where God wills His Son to     be. How could the Will of God be in the past, or yet to happen? What He     wills is now, without a past and wholly futureless. It is as far removed     from time as is a tiny candle from a distant star, or what you chose from     what you really want. </p><p> Heaven remains your one alternative to this strange world you made and all     its ways; its shifting patterns and uncertain goals, its painful pleasures     and its tragic joys. God made no contradictions. What denies its own existence     and attacks itself is not of Him. He did not make two minds, with Heaven     as the glad effect of one, and earth the other's sorry outcome which is     Heaven's opposite in every way. </p><p> God does not suffer conflict. Nor is His creation split in two. How could     it be His Son could be in hell, when God Himself established him in Heaven?     Could he lose what the Eternal Will has given him to be his home forever?     Let us not try longer to impose an alien will upon God's single purpose.     He is here because He wills to be, and what He wills is present now, beyond     the reach of time. </p><p> Today we will not choose a paradox in place of truth. How could the Son of     God make time to take away the Will of God? He thus denies himself, and     contradicts what has no opposite. He thinks he made a hell opposing Heaven,     and believes that he abides in what does not exist, while Heaven is the     place he cannot find. </p><p> Leave foolish thoughts like these behind today, and turn your mind to true     ideas instead. No one can fail who seeks to reach the truth, and it is truth     we seek to reach today. We will devote ten minutes to this goal three times     today, and we will ask to see the rising of the real world to replace the     foolish images that we hold dear, with true ideas arising in the place of     thoughts that have no meaning, no effect, and neither source nor substance     in the truth. </p><p> This we acknowledge as we start upon our practice periods. Begin with this: </p>     <p><i>I ask to see a different world, and think a different kind of           thought from          those I made. <br />The world I seek I did not make           alone, the thoughts I want          to think are not my own. </i></p><p>For several minutes watch your mind and see, although your eyes are closed,     the senseless world you think is real. Review the thoughts as well which     are compatible with such a world, and which you think are true. Then let     them go, and sink below them to the holy place where they can enter not.     There is a door beneath them in your mind, which you could not completely     lock to hide what lies beyond. </p><p> Seek for that door and find it. But before you try to open it, remind yourself     no one can fail who seeks to reach the truth. And it is this request you     make today. Nothing but this has any meaning now; no other goal is valued     now nor sought, nothing before this door you really want, and only what     lies past it do you seek. </p><p> Put out your hand, and see how easily the door swings open with your one     intent to go beyond it. Angels light the way, so that all darkness vanishes,     and you are standing in a light so bright and clear that you can understand     all things you see. A tiny moment of surprise, perhaps, will make you pause     before you realize the world you see before you in the light reflects the     truth you knew, and did not quite forget in wandering away in dreams. </p><p> You cannot fail today. There walks with you the Spirit Heaven sent you, that     you might approach this door some day, and through His aid slip effortlessly     past it, to the light. Today that day has come. Today God keeps His ancient     promise to His holy Son, as does His Son remember his to Him. This is a     day of gladness, for we come to the appointed time and place where you will     find the goal of all your searching here, and all the seeking of the world,     which end together as you pass beyond the door. </p><p> Remember often that today should be a time of special gladness, and refrain     from dismal thoughts and meaningless laments. Salvation's time has come.     Today is set by Heaven itself to be a time of grace for you and for the     world. If you forget this happy fact, remind yourself with this: </p>     <p><i>Today I seek and find all that I want. <br />          My single purpose offers it to me.                    <br />          No one can fail who seeks to reach the truth. </i></p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
