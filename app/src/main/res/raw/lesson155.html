You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently. Your     forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet. And the ones who walk the world     as you do recognize their own. Yet those who have not yet perceived the     way will recognize you also, and believe that you are like them, as you     were before. </p><p> The world is an illusion. Those who choose to come to it are seeking for     a place where they can be illusions, and avoid their own reality. Yet when     they find their own reality is even here, then they step back and let it     lead the way. What other choice is really theirs to make? To let illusions     walk ahead of truth is madness. But to let illusion sink behind the truth     and let the truth stand forth as what it is, is merely sanity. </p><p> This is the simple choice we make today. The mad illusion will remain awhile     in evidence, for those to look upon who chose to come, and have not yet     rejoiced to find they were mistaken in their choice. They cannot learn directly     from the truth, because they have denied that it is so. And so they need     a Teacher Who perceives their madness, but Who still can look beyond illusion     to the simple truth in them. </p><p> If truth demanded they give up the world, it would appear to them as if it     asked the sacrifice of something that is real. Many have chosen to renounce     the world while still believing its reality. And they have suffered from     a sense of loss, and have not been released accordingly. Others have chosen     nothing but the world, and they have suffered from a sense of loss still     deeper, which they did not understand. </p><p> Between these paths there is another road that leads away from loss of every     kind, for sacrifice and deprivation both are quickly left behind. This is     the way appointed for you now. You walk this path as others walk, nor do     you seem to be distinct from them, although you are indeed. Thus can you     serve them while you serve yourself, and set their footsteps on the way     that God has opened up to you, and them through you. </p><p> Illusion still appears to cling to you, that you may reach them. Yet it has     stepped back. And it is not illusion that they hear you speak of, nor illusion     that you bring their eyes to look on and their minds to grasp. Nor can the     truth, which walks ahead of you, speak to them through illusions, for the     road leads past illusion now, while on the way you call to them, that they     may follow you. </p><p> All roads will lead to this one in the end. For sacrifice and deprivation     are paths that lead nowhere, choices for defeat, and aims that will remain     impossible. All this steps back as truth comes forth in you, to lead your     brothers from the ways of death, and set them on the way to happiness. Their     suffering is but illusion. Yet they need a guide to lead them out of it,     for they mistake illusion for the truth. </p><p> Such is salvation's call, and nothing more. It asks that you accept the truth,     and let it go before you, lighting up the path of ransom from illusion.     It is not a ransom with a price. There is no cost, but only gain. Illusion     can but seem to hold in chains the holy Son of God. It is but from illusions     he is saved. As they step back, he finds himself again. </p><p> Walk safely now, yet carefully, because this path is new to you. And you     may find that you are tempted still to walk ahead of truth, and let illusions     be your guide. Your holy brothers have been given you, to follow in your     footsteps as you walk with certainty of purpose to the truth. It goes before     you now, that they may see something with which they can identify; something     they understand to lead the way. </p><p> Yet at the journey's ending there will be no gap, no distance between truth     and you. And all illusions walking in the way you travelled will be gone     from you as well, with nothing left to keep the truth apart from God's completion,     holy as Himself. Step back in faith and let truth lead the way. You know     not where you go. But One Who knows goes with you. Let Him lead you with     the rest. </p><p> When dreams are over, time has closed the door on all the things that pass     and miracles are purposeless, the holy Son of God will make no journeys.     There will be no wish to be illusion rather than the truth. And we step     forth toward this, as we progress along the way that truth points out to     us. This is our final journey, which we make for everyone. We must not lose     our way. For as truth goes before us, so it goes before our brothers who     will follow us. </p><p> We walk to God. Pause and reflect on this. Could any way be holier, or more     deserving of your effort, of your love and of your full intent? What way     could give you more than everything, or offer less and still content the     holy Son of God? We walk to God. The truth that walks before us now is one     with Him, and leads us to where He has always been. What way but this could     be a path that you would choose instead? </p><p> Your feet are safely set upon the road that leads the world to God. Look     not to ways that seem to lead you elsewhere. Dreams are not a worthy guide     for you who are God's Son. Forget not He has placed His Hand in yours, and     given you your brothers in His trust that you are worthy of His trust in     you. He cannot be deceived. His trust has made your pathway certain and     your goal secure. You will not fail your brothers nor your Self. </p><p> And now He asks but that you think of Him a while each day, that He may speak     to you and tell you of His Love, reminding you how great His trust; how     limitless His Love. In your Name and His Own, which are the same, we practice     gladly with this thought today: </p>     <p><i>I will step back and let Him lead the way,<br />     </i><i>For I would walk along the road to Him. </i></p><p> </p>		  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
