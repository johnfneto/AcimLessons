It promises there is no cause for guilt, and being causeless it does not     exist. It follows surely from the basic thought so often mentioned in the     text; ideas leave not their source. If this be true, how can you be apart     from God? How could you walk the world alone and separate from your Source? </p><p> We are not inconsistent in the thoughts that we present in our curriculum.     Truth must be true throughout, if it be true. It cannot contradict itself,     nor be in parts uncertain and in others sure. You cannot walk the world     apart from God, because you could not be without Him. He is what your life     is. Where you are He is. There is one life. That life you share with Him.     Nothing can be apart from Him and live. </p><p> Yet where He is, there must be holiness as well as life. No attribute of     His remains unshared by everything that lives. What lives is holy as Himself,     because what shares His life is part of Holiness, and could no more be sinful     than the sun could choose to be of ice; the sea elect to be apart from water,     or the grass to grow with roots suspended in the air. </p><p> There is a light in you which cannot die; whose presence is so holy that     the world is sanctified because of you. All things that live bring gifts     to you, and offer them in gratitude and gladness at your feet. The scent     of flowers is their gift to you. The waves bow down before you, and the     trees extend their arms to shield you from the heat, and lay their leaves     before you on the ground that you may walk in softness, while the wind sinks     to a whisper round your holy head. </p><p> The light in you is what the universe longs to behold. All living things     are still before you, for they recognize Who walks with you. The light you     carry is their own. And thus they see in you their holiness, saluting you     as savior and as God. Accept their reverence, for it is due to Holiness     Itself, which walks with you, transforming in Its gentle light all things     unto Its likeness and Its purity. </p><p> This is the way salvation works. As you step back, the light in you steps     forward and encompasses the world. It heralds not the end of sin in punishment     and death. In lightness and in laughter is sin gone, because its quaint     absurdity is seen. It is a foolish thought, a silly dream, not frightening,     ridiculous perhaps, but who would waste an instant in approach to God Himself     for such a senseless whim? </p><p> Yet you have wasted many, many years on just this foolish thought. The past     is gone, with all its fantasies. They keep you bound no longer. The approach     to God is near. And in the little interval of doubt that still remains,     you may perhaps lose sight of your Companion, and mistake Him for the senseless,     ancient dream that now is past. </p><p> "Who walks with me?" This question should be asked a thousand times     a day, till certainty has ended doubting and established peace. Today let     doubting cease. God speaks for you in answering your question with these     words: </p>     <p><i>I walk with God in perfect holiness. I light the world,           I light my mind and          all the minds which God created           one with me. </i></p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
