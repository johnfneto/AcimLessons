			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 16</h3>    <p align="center"><b>I have no neutral thoughts. </b></p><p> The idea for today is a beginning step in dispelling the belief that your     thoughts have no effect. Everything you see is the result of your thoughts.     There is no exception to this fact. Thoughts are not big or little; powerful     or weak. They are merely true or false. Those that are true create their     own likeness. Those that are false make theirs. </p><p> There is no more self-contradictory concept than that of "idle thoughts." What     gives rise to the perception of a whole world can hardly be called idle.     Every thought you have contributes to truth or to illusion; either it extends     the truth or it multiplies illusions. You can indeed multiply nothing, but     you will not extend it by doing so. </p><p> Besides your recognizing that thoughts are never idle, salvation requires     that you also recognize that every thought you have brings either peace     or war; either love or fear. A neutral result is impossible because a neutral     thought is impossible. There is such a temptation to dismiss fear thoughts     as unimportant, trivial and not worth bothering about that it is essential     you recognize them all as equally destructive, but equally unreal. We will     practice this idea in many forms before you really understand it. </p><p> In applying the idea for today, search your mind for a minute or so with     eyes closed, and actively seek not to overlook any "little" thought     that may tend to elude the search. This is quite difficult until you get     used to it. You will find that it is still hard for you not to make artificial     distinctions. Every thought that occurs to you, regardless of the qualities     that you assign to it, is a suitable subject for applying today's idea. </p><p> In the practice periods, first repeat the idea to yourself, and then as each     one crosses your mind hold it in awareness while you tell yourself: </p>     <p><i>This thought about ________ is not a neutral thought.<br />     </i><i>That thought about ________ is not a neutral thought. </i></p><p> As usual, use today's idea whenever you are aware of a particular thought     that arouses uneasiness. The following form is suggested for this purpose: </p><p> </p>     <p><i>This thought about ________ is not a neutral thought, because I have          no neutral thoughts. </i></p><p> Four or five practice periods are recommended, if you find them relatively     effortless. If strain is experienced, three will be enough. The length of     the exercise period should also be reduced if there is discomfort. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
