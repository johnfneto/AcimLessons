Here is salvation in the simple     words in which we practice with today's idea. Here is the answer to temptation     which can never fail to welcome in the Christ where fear and anger had prevailed     before. Here is Atonement made complete, the world passed safely by and     Heaven now restored. Here is the answer of the Voice for God. </p><p> Complete abstraction is the natural condition of the mind. But part of it     is now unnatural. It does not look on everything as one. It sees instead     but fragments of the whole, for only thus could it invent the partial world     you see. The purpose of all seeing is to show you what you wish to see.     All hearing but brings to your mind the sounds it wants to hear. </p><p> Thus were specifics made. And now it is specifics we must use in practicing.     We give them to the Holy Spirit, that He may employ them for a purpose which     is different from the one we gave to them. Yet He can use but what we made,     to teach us from a different point of view, so we can see a different use     in everything. </p><p> One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind     is one. Such is the truth. Yet do these thoughts make clear the meaning     of creation? Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you? What     can they seem to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment,     yet fundamentally not understood nor understandable. The mind that taught     itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense     that it is all-encompassing. We need to see a little, that we learn a lot. </p><p> It seems to be the body that we feel limits our freedom, makes us suffer,     and at last puts out our life. Yet bodies are but symbols for a concrete     form of fear. Fear without symbols calls for no response, for symbols can     stand for the meaningless. Love needs no symbols, being true. But fear attaches     to specifics, being false. </p><p> Bodies attack, but minds do not. This thought is surely reminiscent of our     text, where it is often emphasized. This is the reason bodies easily become     fear's symbols. You have many times been urged to look beyond the body,     for its sight presents the symbol of love's "enemy" Christ's vision     does not see. The body is the target for attack, for no one thinks he hates     a mind. Yet what but mind directs the body to attack? What else could be     the seat of fear except what thinks of fear? </p><p> Hate is specific. There must be a thing to be attacked. An enemy must be     perceived in such a form he can be touched and seen and heard, and ultimately     killed. When hatred rests upon a thing, it calls for death as surely as     God's Voice proclaims there is no death. Fear is insatiable, consuming everything     its eyes behold, seeing itself in everything, compelled to turn upon itself     and to destroy. </p><p> Who sees a brother as a body sees him as fear's symbol. And he will attack,     because what he beholds is his own fear external to himself, poised to attack,     and howling to unite with him again. Mistake not the intensity of rage projected     fear must spawn. It shrieks in wrath, and claws the air in frantic hope     it can reach to its maker and devour him. </p><p> This do the body's eyes behold in one whom Heaven cherishes, the angels love     and God created perfect. This is his reality. And in Christ's vision is     his loveliness reflected in a form so holy and so beautiful that you could     scarce refrain from kneeling at his feet. Yet you will take his hand instead,     for you are like him in the sight that sees him thus. Attack on him is enemy     to you, for you will not perceive that in his hands is your salvation. Ask     him but for this, and he will give it to you. Ask him not to symbolize your     fear. Would you request that love destroy itself? Or would you have it be     revealed to you and set you free? </p><p> Today we practice in a form we have attempted earlier. Your readiness is     closer now, and you will come today nearer Christ's vision. If you are intent     on reaching it, you will succeed today. And once you have succeeded, you     will not be willing to accept the witnesses your body's eyes call forth.     What you will see will sing to you of ancient melodies you will remember.     You are not forgot in Heaven. Would you not remember it? </p><p> Select one brother, symbol of the rest, and ask salvation of him. See him     first as clearly as you can, in that same form to which you are accustomed.     See his face, his hands and feet, his clothing. Watch him smile, and see     familiar gestures which he makes so frequently. Then think of this: What     you are seeing now conceals from you the sight of one who can forgive you     all your sins; whose sacred hands can take away the nails which pierce your     own, and lift the crown of thorns which you have placed upon your bleeding     head. Ask this of him, that he may set you free: </p>     <p><i>Give me your blessing, holy Son of God. <br />          I would behold you with the eyes of          Christ,           and see my perfect sinlessness in you. </i></p><p> And He will answer Whom you called upon. For He will hear the Voice for God     in you, and answer in your own. Behold him now, whom you have seen as merely     flesh and bone, and recognize that Christ has come to you. Today's idea     is your safe escape from anger and from fear. Be sure you use it instantly,     should you be tempted to attack a brother and perceive in him the symbol     of your fear. And you will see him suddenly transformed from enemy to savior;     from the devil into Christ. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
