What but your thoughts of misery and death obscure the perfect     happiness and the eternal life your Father wills for you? And what could     hide what cannot be concealed except illusion? What could keep from you     what you already have except your choice to see it not, denying it is there? </p><p> The Thought of God created you. It left you not, nor have you ever been apart     from it an instant. It belongs to you. By it you live. It is your Source     of life, holding you one with it, and everything is one with you because     it left you not. The Thought of God protects you, cares for you, makes soft     your resting place and smooth your way, lighting your mind with happiness     and love. Eternity and everlasting life shine in your mind, because the     Thought of God has left you not, and still abides with you. </p><p> Who would deny his safety and his peace, his joy, his healing and his peace     of mind, his quiet rest, his calm awakening, if he but recognized where     they abide? Would he not instantly prepare to go where they are found, abandoning     all else as worthless in comparison with them? And having found them, would     he not make sure they stay with him, and he remain with them? </p><p> Deny not Heaven. It is yours today, but for the asking. Nor need you perceive     how great the gift, how changed your mind will be before it comes to you.     Ask to receive, and it is given you. Conviction lies within it. Till you     welcome it as yours, uncertainty remains. Yet God is fair. Sureness is not     required to receive what only your acceptance can bestow. </p><p> Ask with desire. You need not be sure that you request the only thing you     want. But when you have received, you will be sure you have the treasure     you have always sought. What would you then exchange for it? What would     induce you now to let it fade away from your ecstatic vision? For this sight     proves that you have exchanged your blindness for the seeing eyes of Christ;     your mind has come to lay aside denial, and accept the Thought of God as     your inheritance. </p><p> Now is all doubting past, the journey's end made certain, and salvation given     you. Now is Christ's power in your mind, to heal as you were healed. For     now you are among the saviors of the world. Your destiny lies there and     nowhere else. Would God consent to let His Son remain forever starved by     his denial of the nourishment he needs to live? Abundance dwells in him,     and deprivation cannot cut him off from God's sustaining Love and from his     home. </p><p> Practice today in hope. For hope indeed is justified. Your doubts are meaningless,     for God is certain. And the Thought of Him is never absent. Sureness must     abide within you who are host to Him. This course removes all doubts which     you have interposed between Him and your certainty of Him. </p><p> We count on God, and not upon ourselves, to give us certainty. And in His     Name we practice as His Word directs we do. His sureness lies beyond our     every doubt. His Love remains beyond our every fear. The Thought of Him     is still beyond all dreams and in our minds, according to His Will. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
