He is not distant. He makes     no attempt to hide from us. We try to hide from Him, and suffer from deception.     He remains entirely accessible. He loves His Son. There is no certainty     but this, yet this suffices. He will love His Son forever. When his mind     remains asleep, He loves him still. And when his mind awakes, He loves him     with a never-changing Love. </p><p> If you but knew the meaning of His Love, hope and despair would be impossible.     For hope would be forever satisfied; despair of any kind unthinkable. His     grace His answer is to all despair, for in it lies remembrance of His Love.     Would He not gladly give the means by which His Will is recognized? His     grace is yours by your acknowledgment. And memory of Him awakens in the     mind that asks the means of Him whereby its sleep is done. </p><p> Today we ask of God the gift He has most carefully preserved within our hearts,     waiting to be acknowledged. This the gift by which God leans to us and lifts     us up, taking salvation's final step Himself. All steps but this we learn,     instructed by His Voice. But finally He comes Himself, and takes us in His     Arms and sweeps away the cobwebs of our sleep. His gift of grace is more     than just an answer. It restores all memories the sleeping mind forgot;     all certainty of what Love's meaning is. </p><p> God loves His Son. Request Him now to give the means by which this world     will disappear, and vision first will come, with knowledge but an instant     later. For in grace you see a light that covers all the world in love, and     watch fear disappear from every face as hearts rise up and claim the light     as theirs. What now remains that Heaven be delayed an instant longer? What     is still undone when your forgiveness rests on everything? </p><p> It is a new and holy day today, for we receive what has been given us. Our     faith lies in the Giver, not our own acceptance. We acknowledge our mistakes,     but He to Whom all error is unknown is yet the One Who answers our mistakes     by giving us the means to lay them down, and rise to Him in gratitude and     love. </p><p> And He descends to meet us, as we come to Him. For what He has prepared for     us He gives and we receive. Such is His Will, because He loves His Son.     To Him we pray today, returning but the word He gave to us through His Own     Voice, His Word, His Love: </p>     <p><i>Your grace is given me. <br />I claim it now. <br />          Father, I come           to You.<br /> And You will          come to me who ask. <br />          I am the Son You love. </i></p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
