<font face="verdana" size="4">		    <h3 p align="center">Lesson 171</h3>    <p align="center"><b>REVIEW V<br />Introduction</b></p><p>We now review again. This time we are ready to give more     effort and more time to what we undertake. We recognize we are preparing     for another phase of understanding. We would take this step completely,     that we may go on again more certain, more sincere, with faith upheld more     surely. Our footsteps have not been unwavering, and doubts have made us     walk uncertainly and slowly on the road this course sets forth. But now     we hasten on, for we approach a greater certainty, a firmer purpose and     a surer goal.</p><p><i>Steady our feet, our Father. Let our doubts be quiet          and our holy minds be still, and speak to us. We have no words to give          to You. We would but listen to Your Word, and make it ours. Lead our          practicing as does a father lead a little child along a way he does          not understand. Yet does he follow, sure that he is safe because his          father leads the way for him.</i></p><p><i>So do we bring our practicing to You. And if we stumble,          You will raise us up. If we forget the way, we count upon Your sure          remembering. We wander off, but You will not forget to call us back.          Quicken our footsteps now, that we may walk more certainly and quickly          unto You. And we accept the Word You offer us to unify our practicing,          as we review the thoughts that You have given us.</i></p><p>This is the thought which should precede the thoughts     that we review. Each one but clarifies some aspect of this thought, or helps     it be more meaningful, more personal and true, and more descriptive of the     holy Self we share and now prepare to know again:</p>     <p align="center"><i>God is but Love, and therefore so am I.</i></p><p>This Self alone knows Love. This Self alone is perfectly consistent in Its     Thoughts; knows Its Creator, understands Itself, is perfect in Its knowledge     and Its Love, and never changes from Its constant state of union with Its     Father and Itself.</p><p>And it is this that waits to meet us at the journey's     ending. Every step we take brings us a little nearer. This review will shorten     time immeasurably, if we keep in mind that this remains our goal, and as     we practice it is this to which we are approaching. Let us raise our hearts     from dust to life, as we remember this is promised us, and that this course     was sent to open up the path of light to us, and teach us, step by step,     how to return to the eternal Self we thought we lost. </p><p>I take the journey with you. For I share your doubts and fears     a little while, that you may come to me who recognize the road by which     all fears and doubts are overcome. We walk together. I must understand uncertainty     and pain, although I know they have no meaning. Yet a savior must remain     with those he teaches, seeing what they see, but still retaining in his     mind the way that led him out, and now will lead you out with him. God's     Son is crucified until you walk along the road with me. </p><p>My resurrection comes again each time I lead a brother safely to the place     at which the journey ends and is forgot. I am renewed each time a brother     learns there is a way from misery and pain. I am reborn each time a brother's     mind turns to the light in him and looks for me. I have forgotten no one.     Help me now to lead you back to where the journey was begun, to make another     choice with me.</p><p>Release me as you practice once again the thoughts I brought to you from     Him Who sees your bitter need, and knows the answer God has given Him. Together     we review these thoughts. Together we devote our time and effort to them.     And together we will teach them to our brothers. God would not have Heaven     incomplete. It waits for you, as I do. I am incomplete without your part     in me. And as I am made whole we go together to our ancient home, prepared     for us before time was and kept unchanged by time, immaculate and safe,     as it will be at last when time is done.</p><p>Let this review be then your gift to me. For this alone I need; that you     will hear the words I speak, and give them to the world. You are my voice,     my eyes, my feet, my hands through which I save the world. The Self from     which I call to you is but your own. To Him we go together. Take your brother's     hand, for this is not a way we walk alone. In him I walk with you, and you     with me. Our Father wills His Son be one with Him. What lives but must not     then be one with you?</p><p>Let this review become a time in which we share a new experience for you,     yet one as old as time and older still. Hallowed your Name. Your glory undefiled     forever. And your wholeness now complete, as God established it. You are     His Son, completing His extension in your own. We practice but an ancient     truth we knew before illusion seemed to claim the world. And we remind the     world that it is free of all illusions every time we say:&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><i>God is but Love, and therefore so am I.</i></p><p>With this we start each day of our review. With this we start and end     each period of practice time. And with this thought we sleep, to waken once     again with these same words upon our lips, to greet another day. No thought     that we review but we surround with it, and use the thoughts to hold it     up before our minds, and keep it clear in our rememberance throughout the     day. And thus, when we have finished this review, we will have recognized     the words we speak are true.</p><p>Yet are the words but aids, and to be used, except at the beginning and     the end of practice periods, but to recall the mind, as needed, to its purpose.     We place faith in the experience that comes from practice, not the means     we use. We wait for the experience, and recognize that it is only here conviction     lies. We use the words, and try and try again to go beyond them to their     meaning, which is far beyond their sound. The sound grows dim and disappears,     as we approach the Source of meaning. It is Here that we find rest.</p><hr /><p align="center"><b><a name="lesson_171" id="lesson_171"></a>Lesson 171</b></p><p align="center"><b>God     is but Love, and therefore so am I. </b></p>     <p>(151) All things are echoes of the Voice for God.</p>               <p><b> God is but Love, and therefore so am I. </b></p>          <p>(152) The power of decision is my own.</p>               <p><b> God is but Love, and therefore so am I.</b></p>
