of my seeing. </b>
<p> The idea for today is another step in learning that the thoughts which give     
rise to what you see are never neutral or unimportant. It also emphasizes     
the idea that minds are joined, which will be given increasing stress later     
on. </p>
<p> Today's idea does not refer to what you see as much as to how you see it.     
Therefore, the exercises for today emphasize this aspect of your perception.     
The three or four practice periods which are recommended should be done     
as follows: </p>
<p> Look about you, selecting subjects for the application of the idea for today     
as randomly as possible, and keeping your eyes on each one long enough to     
say: </p>
<p><i>I am not alone in experiencing the effects of how I see _________. </i></p>
<p>Conclude each practice period by repeating the more general statement: </p>
<p><i>I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my seeing. </i></p>
<p>A minute or so, or even less, will be sufficient for each practice period. </p>
