When you attack a brother, you proclaim that he is limited          by what you have perceived in him. You do not look beyond his errors.          Rather, they are magnified, becoming blocks to your awareness of the          Self that lies beyond your own mistakes, and past his seeming sins          as well as yours. </p>     <p> Perception has a focus. It is this that gives consistency to what you          see. Change but this focus, and what you behold will change accordingly.          Your vision now will shift, to give support to the intent which has          replaced the one you held before. Remove your focus on your brother's          sins, and you experience the peace that comes from faith in sinlessness.          This faith receives its only sure support from what you see in others          past their sins. For their mistakes, if focused on, are witnesses to          sins in you. And you will not transcend their sight and see the sinlessness          that lies beyond. </p>     <p> Therefore, in practicing today, we first let all such little focuses          give way to our great need to let our sinlessness become apparent.          We instruct our minds that it is this we seek, and only this, for just          a little while. We do not care about our future goals. And what we          saw an instant previous has no concern for us within this interval          of time wherein we practice changing our intent. We seek for innocence          and nothing else. We seek for it with no concern but now. </p>     <p> A major hazard to success has been involvement with your past and future          goals. You have been quite preoccupied with how extremely different          the goals this course is advocating are from those you held before.          And you have also been dismayed by the depressing and restricting thought          that, even if you should succeed, you will inevitably lose your way          again. </p>     <p> How could this matter? For the past is gone; the future but imagined.          These concerns are but defenses against present change of focus in          perception. Nothing more. We lay these pointless limitations by a little          while. We do not look to past beliefs, and what we will believe will          not intrude upon us now. We enter in the time of practicing with one          intent; to look upon the sinlessness within. </p>     <p> We recognize that we have lost this goal if anger blocks our way in          any form. And if a brother's sins occur to us, our narrowed focus will          restrict our sight, and turn our eyes upon our own mistakes, which          we will magnify and call our "sins." So, for a little while,          without regard to past or future, should such blocks arise we will          transcend them with instructions to our minds to change their focus,          as we say: </p>               <p><i>It is not this that I would look upon.<br />          </i><i>I trust my brothers, who are one with me. </i></p>          <p> And we will also use this thought to keep us safe throughout the day.          We do not seek for long-range goals. As each obstruction seems to block          the vision of our sinlessness, we seek but for surcease an instant          from the misery the focus upon sin will bring, and uncorrected will          remain. </p>     <p> Nor do we ask for fantasies. For what we seek to look upon is really          there. And as our focus goes beyond mistakes, we will behold a wholly          sinless world. When seeing this is all we want to see, when this is          all we seek for in the name of true perception, are the eyes of Christ          inevitably ours. And the Love He feels for us becomes our own as well.          This will become the only thing we see reflected in the world and in          ourselves. </p>     <p> The world which once proclaimed our sins becomes the proof that we are          sinless. And our love for everyone we look upon attests to our remembrance          of the holy Self which knows no sin, and never could conceive of anything          without Its sinlessness. We seek for this remembrance as we turn our          minds to practicing today. We look neither ahead nor backwards. We          look straight into the present. And we give our trust to the experience          we ask for now. Our sinlessness is but the Will of God. This instant          is our willing one with His. </p>     <p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
