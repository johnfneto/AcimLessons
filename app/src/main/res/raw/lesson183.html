To call upon His Name is but     to call upon your own. A father gives his son his name, and thus identifies     the son with him. His brothers share his name, and thus are they united     in a bond to which they turn for their identity. Your Father's Name reminds     you who you are, even within a world that does not know; even though you     have not remembered it. </p><p> God's Name can not be heard without response, nor said without an echo in     the mind that calls you to remember. Say His Name, and you invite the angels     to surround the ground on which you stand, and sing to you as they spread     out their wings to keep you safe, and shelter you from every worldly thought     that would intrude upon your holiness. </p><p> Repeat God's Name, and all the world responds by laying down illusions. Every     dream the world holds dear has suddenly gone by, and where it seemed to     stand you find a star; a miracle of grace. The sick arise, healed of their     sickly thoughts. The blind can see; the deaf can hear. The sorrowful cast     off their mourning, and the tears of pain are dried as happy laughter comes     to bless the world. </p><p> Repeat the Name of God, and little names have lost their meaning. No temptation     but becomes a nameless and unwanted thing before God's Name. Repeat His     Name, and see how easily you will forget the names of all the gods you valued.     They have lost the name of god you gave them. They become anonymous and     valueless to you, although before you let the Name of God replace their     little names, you stood before them worshipfully, naming them as gods. </p><p> Repeat the Name of God, and call upon your Self, Whose Name is His. Repeat     His Name, and all the tiny, nameless things on earth slip into right perspective.     Those who call upon the Name of God can not mistake the nameless for the     Name, nor sin for grace, nor bodies for the holy Son of God. And should     you join a brother as you sit with him in silence, and repeat God's Name     along with him within your quiet mind, you have established there an altar     which reaches to God Himself and to His Son. </p><p> Practice but this today; repeat God's Name slowly again and still again.     Become oblivious to every name but His. Hear nothing else. Let all your     thoughts become anchored on this. No other word we use except at the beginning,     when we say today's idea but once. And then God's Name becomes our only     thought, our only word, the only thing that occupies our minds, the only     wish we have, the only sound with any meaning, and the only Name of everything     that we desire to see; of everything that we would call our own. </p><p> Thus do we give an invitation which can never be refused. And God will come,     and answer it Himself. Think not He hears the little prayers of those who     call on Him with names of idols cherished by the world. They cannot reach     Him thus. He cannot hear requests that He be not Himself, or that His Son     receive another name than His. </p><p> Repeat God's Name, and you acknowledge Him as sole Creator of reality. And     you acknowledge also that His Son is part of Him, creating in His Name.     Sit silently, and let His Name become the all-encompassing idea that holds     your mind completely. Let all thoughts be still except this one. And to     all other thoughts respond with this, and see God's Name replace the thousand     little names you gave your thoughts, not realizing that there is one Name     for all there is, and all that there will be. </p><p> Today you can achieve a state in which you will experience the gift of grace.     You can escape all bondage of the world, and give the world the same release     you found. You can remember what the world forgot, and offer it your own     remembering. You can accept today the part you play in its salvation, and     your own as well. And both can be accomplished perfectly. </p><p> Turn to the Name of God for your release, and it is given you. No prayer     but this is necessary, for it holds them all within it. Words are insignificant,     and all requests unneeded when God's Son calls on his Father's Name. His     Father's Thoughts become his own. He makes his claim to all his Father gave,     is giving still, and will forever give. He calls on Him to let all things     he thought he made be nameless now, and in their place the holy Name of     God becomes his judgment of their worthlessness. </p><p> All little things are silent. Little sounds are soundless now. The little     things of earth have disappeared. The universe consists of nothing but the     Son of God, who calls upon his Father. And his Father's Voice gives answer     in his Father's holy Name. In this eternal, still relationship, in which     communication far transcends all words, and yet exceeds in depth and height     whatever words could possibly convey, is peace eternal. In our Father's     Name, we would experience this peace today. And in His Name, it shall be     given us. </p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
