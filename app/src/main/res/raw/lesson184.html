You have made up names for everything you see. Each     one becomes a separate entity, identified by its own name. By this you carve     it out of unity. By this you designate its special attributes, and set it     off from other things by emphasizing space surrounding it. This space you     lay between all things to which you give a different name; all happenings     in terms of place and time; all bodies which are greeted by a name. </p><p> This space you see as setting off all things from one another is the means     by which the world's perception is achieved. You see something where nothing     is, and see as well nothing where there is unity; a space between all things,     between all things and you. Thus do you think that you have given life in     separation. By this split you think you are established as a unity which     functions with an independent will. </p><p> What are these names by which the world becomes a series of discrete events,     of things ununified, of bodies kept apart and holding bits of mind as separate     awarenesses? You gave these names to them, establishing perception as you     wished to have perception be. The nameless things were given names, and     thus reality was given them as well. For what is named is given meaning     and will then be seen as meaningful; a cause of true effect, with consequence     inherent in itself. </p><p> This is the way reality is made by partial vision, purposefully set against     the given truth. Its enemy is wholeness. It conceives of little things and     looks upon them. And a lack of space, a sense of unity or vision that sees     differently, become the threats which it must overcome, conflict with and     deny. </p><p> Yet does this other vision still remain a natural direction for the mind     to channel its perception. It is hard to teach the mind a thousand alien     names, and thousands more. Yet you believe this is what learning means;     its one essential goal by which communication is achieved, and concepts     can be meaningfully shared. </p><p> This is the sum of the inheritance the world bestows. And everyone who learns     to think that it is so accepts the signs and symbols that assert the world     is real. It is for this they stand. They leave no doubt that what is named     is there. It can be seen, as is anticipated. What denies that it is true     is but illusion, for it is the ultimate reality. To question it is madness;     to accept its presence is the proof of sanity. </p><p> Such is the teaching of the world. It is a phase of learning everyone who     comes must go through. But the sooner he perceives on what it rests, how     questionable are its premises, how doubtful its results, the sooner does     he question its effects. Learning that stops with what the world would teach     stops short of meaning. In its proper place, it serves but as a starting     point from which another kind of learning can begin, a new perception can     be gained, and all the arbitrary names the world bestows can be withdrawn     as they are raised to doubt. </p><p> Think not you made the world. Illusions, yes! But what is true in earth and     Heaven is beyond your naming. When you call upon a brother, it is to his     body that you make appeal. His true Identity is hidden from you by what     you believe he really is. His body makes response to what you call him,     for his mind consents to take the name you give him as his own. And thus     his unity is twice denied, for you perceive him separate from you, and he     accepts this separate name as his. </p><p> It would indeed be strange if you were asked to go beyond all symbols of     the world, forgetting them forever; yet were asked to take a teaching function.     You have need to use the symbols of the world a while. But be you not deceived     by them as well. They do not stand for anything at all, and in your practicing     it is this thought that will release you from them. They become but means     by which you can communicate in ways the world can understand, but which     you recognize is not the unity where true communication can be found. </p><p> Thus what you need are intervals each day in which the learning of the world     becomes a transitory phase; a prison house from which you go into the sunlight     and forget the darkness. Here you understand the Word, the Name which God     has given you; the one Identity which all things share; the one acknowledgment     of what is true. And then step back to darkness, not because you think it     real, but only to proclaim its unreality in terms which still have meaning     in the world that darkness rules. </p><p> Use all the little names and symbols which delineate the world of darkness.     Yet accept them not as your reality. The Holy Spirit uses all of them, but     He does not forget creation has one Name, one meaning, and a single Source     which unifies all things within Itself. Use all the names the world bestows     on them but for convenience, yet do not forget they share the Name of God     along with you. </p><p> God has no name. And yet His Name becomes the final lesson that all things     are one, and at this lesson does all learning end. All names are unified;     all space is filled with truth's reflection. Every gap is closed, and separation     healed. The Name of God is the inheritance He gave to those who chose the     teaching of the world to take the place of Heaven. In our practicing, our     purpose is to let our minds accept what God has given as the answer to the     pitiful inheritance you made as fitting tribute to the Son He loves. </p><p> No one can fail who seeks the meaning of the Name of God. Experience must     come to supplement the Word. But first you must accept the Name for all     reality, and realize the many names you gave its aspects have distorted     what you see, but have not interfered with truth at all. One Name we bring     into our practicing. One Name we use to unify our sight. </p><p> And though we use a different name for each awareness of an aspect of God's     Son, we understand that they have but one Name, which He has given them.     It is this Name we use in practicing. And through Its use, all foolish separations     disappear which kept us blind. And we are given strength to see beyond them.     Now our sight is blessed with blessings we can give as we receive. </p>     <p><i> Father, our Name is Yours. In It we are united with all living things, and          You Who are their one Creator. What we made and call by many different names          is but a shadow we have tried to cast across Your Own reality. And we are          glad and thankful we were wrong. All our mistakes we give to You, that we          may be absolved from all effects our errors seemed to have. And we accept          the truth You give, in place of every one of them. Your Name is our salvation          and escape from what we made. Your Name unites us in the oneness which is          our inheritance and peace. Amen. </i></p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
