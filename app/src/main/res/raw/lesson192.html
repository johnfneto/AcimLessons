Yet what can such a function mean within a world of envy,     hatred and attack? </p><p> Therefore, you have a function in the world in its own terms. For who can     understand a language far beyond his simple grasp? Forgiveness represents     your function here. It is not God's creation, for it is the means by which     untruth can be undone. And who would pardon Heaven? Yet on earth, you need     the means to let illusions go. Creation merely waits for your return to     be acknowledged, not to be complete. </p><p> Creation cannot even be conceived of in the world. It has no meaning here.     Forgiveness is the closest it can come to earth. For being Heaven-born,     it has no form at all. Yet God created One Who has the power to translate     in form the wholly formless. What He makes are dreams, but of a kind so     close to waking that the light of day already shines in them, and eyes already     opening behold the joyful sights their offerings contain. </p><p> Forgiveness gently looks upon all things unknown in Heaven, sees them disappear,     and leaves the world a clean and unmarked slate on which the Word of God     can now replace the senseless symbols written there before. Forgiveness     is the means by which the fear of death is overcome, because it holds no     fierce attraction now and guilt is gone. Forgiveness lets the body be perceived     as what it is; a simple teaching aid, to be laid by when learning is complete,     but hardly changing him who learns at all. </p><p> The mind without the body cannot make mistakes. It cannot think that it will     die, nor be the prey of merciless attack. Anger becomes impossible, and     where is terror then? What fears could still assail those who have lost     the source of all attack, the core of anguish and the seat of fear? Only     forgiveness can relieve the mind of thinking that the body is its home.     Only forgiveness can restore the peace that God intended for His holy Son.     Only forgiveness can persuade the Son to look again upon his holiness. </p><p> With anger gone, you will indeed perceive that, for Christ's vision and the     gift of sight, no sacrifice was asked, and only pain was lifted from a sick     and tortured mind. Is this unwelcome? Is it to be feared? Or is it to be     hoped for, met with thanks and joyously accepted? We are one, and therefore     give up nothing. But we have indeed been given everything by God. </p><p> Yet do we need forgiveness to perceive that this is so. Without its kindly     light we grope in darkness, using reason but to justify our rage and our     attack. Our understanding is so limited that what we think we understand     is but confusion born of error. We are lost in mists of shifting dreams     and fearful thoughts, our eyes shut tight against the light; our minds engaged     in worshipping what is not there. </p><p> Who can be born again in Christ but him who has forgiven everyone he sees     or thinks of or imagines? Who could be set free while he imprisons anyone?     A jailer is not free, for he is bound together with his prisoner. He must     be sure that he does not escape, and so he spends his time in keeping watch     on him. The bars that limit him become the world in which his jailer lives,     along with him. And it is on his freedom that the way to liberty depends     for both of them. </p><p> Therefore, hold no one prisoner. Release instead of bind, for thus are you     made free. The way is simple. Every time you feel a stab of anger, realize     you hold a sword above your head. And it will fall or be averted as you     choose to be condemned or free. Thus does each one who seems to tempt you     to be angry represent your savior from the prison house of death. And so     you owe him thanks instead of pain. </p><p> Be merciful today. The Son of God deserves your mercy. It is he who asks     that you accept the way to freedom now. Deny him not. His Father's Love     for him belongs to you. Your function here on earth is only to forgive him,     that you may accept him back as your Identity. He is as God created him.     And you are what he is. Forgive him now his sins, and you will see that     you are one with him. </p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
