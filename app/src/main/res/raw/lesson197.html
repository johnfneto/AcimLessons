You make attempts at kindness and forgiveness.     Yet you turn them to attack again, unless you find external gratitude and     lavish thanks. Your gifts must be received with honor, lest they be withdrawn.     And so you think God's gifts are loans at best; at worst, deceptions which     would cheat you of defenses, to ensure that when He strikes He will not     fail to kill. </p><p> How easily are God and guilt confused by those who know not what their thoughts     can do. Deny your strength, and weakness must become salvation to you. See     yourself as bound, and bars become your home. Nor will you leave the prison     house, or claim your strength, until guilt and salvation are not seen as     one, and freedom and salvation are perceived as joined, with strength beside     them, to be sought and claimed, and found and fully recognized. </p><p> The world must thank you when you offer it release from your illusions. Yet     your thanks belong to you as well, for its release can only mirror yours.     Your gratitude is all your gifts require, that they be a lasting offering     of a thankful heart, released from hell forever. Is it this you would undo     by taking back your gifts, because they were not honored? It is you who     honor them and give them fitting thanks, for it is you who have received     the gifts. </p><p> It does not matter if another thinks your gifts unworthy. In his mind there     is a part that joins with yours in thanking you. It does not matter if your     gifts seem lost and ineffectual. They are received where they are given.     In your gratitude are they accepted universally, and thankfully acknowledged     by the Heart of God Himself. And would you take them back, when He has gratefully     accepted them? </p><p> God blesses every gift you give to Him, and every gift is given Him, because     it can be given only to yourself. And what belongs to God must be His Own.     Yet you will never realize His gifts are sure, eternal, changeless, limitless,     forever giving out, extending love and adding to your never-ending joy while     you forgive but to attack again. </p><p> Withdraw the gifts you give, and you will think that what is given you has     been withdrawn. But learn to let forgiveness take away the sins you think     you see outside yourself, and you can never think the gifts of God are lent     but for a little while, before He snatches them away again in death. For     death will have no meaning for you then. </p><p> And with the end of this belief is fear forever over. Thank your Self for     this, for He is grateful only unto God, and He gives thanks for you unto     Himself. To everyone who lives will Christ yet come, for everyone must live     and move in Him. His Being in His Father is secure, because Their Will is     One. Their gratitude to all They have created has no end, for gratitude     remains a part of love. </p><p> Thanks be to you, the holy Son of God. For as you were created, you contain     all things within your Self. And you are still as God created you. Nor can     you dim the light of your perfection. In your heart the Heart of God is     laid. He holds you dear, because you are Himself. All gratitude belongs     to you, because of what you are. </p><p> Give thanks as you receive it. Be you free of all ingratitude to anyone who     makes your Self complete. And from this Self is no one left outside. Give     thanks for all the countless channels which extend this Self. All that you     do is given unto Him. All that you think can only be His Thoughts, sharing     with Him the holy Thoughts of God. Earn now the gratitude you have denied     yourself when you forgot the function God has given you. But never think     that He has ever ceased to offer thanks to you. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
