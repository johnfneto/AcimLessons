If you can condemn,     you can be injured. For you have believed that you can injure, and the right     you have established for yourself can be now used against you, till you     lay it down as valueless, unwanted and unreal. Then does illusion cease     to have effects, and those it seemed to have will be undone. Then are you     free, for freedom is your gift, and you can now receive the gift you gave. </p><p> Condemn and you are made a prisoner. Forgive and you are freed. Such is the     law that rules perception. It is not a law that knowledge understands, for     freedom is a part of knowledge. To condemn is thus impossible in truth.     What seems to be its influence and its effects have not occurred at all.     Yet must we deal with them a while as if they had. Illusion makes illusion.     Except one. Forgiveness is illusion that is answer to the rest. </p><p> Forgiveness sweeps all other dreams away, and though it is itself a dream,     it breeds no others. All illusions save this one must multiply a thousandfold.     But this is where illusions end. Forgiveness is the end of dreams, because     it is a dream of waking. It is not itself the truth. Yet does it point to     where the truth must be, and gives direction with the certainty of God Himself.     It is a dream in which the Son of God awakens to his Self and to his Father,     knowing They are One. </p><p> Forgiveness is the only road that leads out of disaster, past all suffering,     and finally away from death. How could there be another way, when this one     is the plan of God Himself? And why would you oppose it, quarrel with it,     seek to find a thousand ways in which it must be wrong; a thousand other     possibilities? </p><p> Is it not wiser to be glad you hold the answer to your problems in your hand?     Is it not more intelligent to thank the One Who gives salvation, and accept     His gift with gratitude? And is it not a kindness to yourself to hear His     Voice and learn the simple lessons He would teach, instead of trying to     dismiss His words, and substitute your own in place of His? </p><p> His words will work. His words will save. His words contain all hope, all     blessing and all joy that ever can be found upon this earth. His words are     born in God, and come to you with Heaven's love upon them. Those who hear     His words have heard the song of Heaven. For these are the words in which     all merge as one at last. And as this one will fade away, the Word of God     will come to take its place, for it will be remembered then and loved. </p><p> This world has many seeming separate haunts where mercy has no meaning, and     attack appears as justified. Yet all are one; a place where death is offered     to God's Son and to his Father. You may think They have accepted. But if     you will look again upon the place where you beheld Their blood, you will     perceive a miracle instead. How foolish to believe that They could die!     How foolish to believe you can attack! How mad to think that you could be     condemned, and that the holy Son of God can die! </p><p> The stillness of your Self remains unmoved, untouched by thoughts like these,     and unaware of any condemnation which could need forgiveness. Dreams of     any kind are strange and alien to the truth. And what but truth could have     a Thought which builds a bridge to it that brings illusions to the other     side? </p><p> Today we practice letting freedom come to make its home with you. The truth     bestows these words upon your mind, that you may find the key to light and     let the darkness end: </p>     <p><i>Only my condemnation injures me.<br />     </i><i>Only my own forgiveness sets me free. </i></p><p>Do not forget today that there can be no form of suffering that fails to hide     an unforgiving thought. Nor can there be a form of pain forgiveness cannot     heal. </p><p> Accept the one illusion which proclaims there is no condemnation in God's     Son, and Heaven is remembered instantly; the world forgotten, all its weird     beliefs forgotten with it, as the face of Christ appears unveiled at last     in this one dream. This is the gift the Holy Spirit holds for you from God     your Father. Let today be celebrated both on earth and in your holy home     as well. Be kind to Both, as you forgive the trespasses you thought Them     guilty of, and see your innocence shining upon you from the face of Christ. </p><p> Now is there silence all around the world. Now is there stillness where before     there was a frantic rush of thoughts that made no sense. Now is there tranquil     light across the face of earth, made quiet in a dreamless sleep. And now     the Word of God alone remains upon it. Only that can be perceived an instant     longer. Then are symbols done, and everything you ever thought you made     completely vanished from the mind that God forever knows to be His only     Son. </p><p> There is no condemnation in him. He is perfect in his holiness. He needs     no thoughts of mercy. Who could give him gifts when everything is his? And     who could dream of offering forgiveness to the Son of Sinlessness Itself,     so like to Him Whose Son he is, that to behold the Son is to perceive no     more, and only know the Father? In this vision of the Son, so brief that     not an instant stands between this single sight and timelessness itself,     you see the vision of yourself, and then you disappear forever into God. </p><p> Today we come still nearer to the end of everything that yet would stand     between this vision and our sight. And we are glad that we have come this     far, and recognize that He Who brought us here will not forsake us now.     For He would give to us the gift that God has given us through Him today.     Now is the time for your deliverance. The time has come. The time has come     today. </p><p> </p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
