Begin     with the things that are near you, and apply the idea to whatever your glance     rests on. Then increase the range outward. Turn your head so that you include     whatever is on either side. If possible, turn around and apply the idea     to what was behind you. Remain as indiscriminate as possible in selecting     subjects for its application, do not concentrate on anything in particular,     and do not attempt to include everything you see in a given area, or you     will introduce strain. </p><p> Merely glance easily and fairly quickly around you, trying to avoid selection     by size, brightness, color, material, or relative importance to you. Take     the subjects simply as you see them. Try to apply the exercise with equal     ease to a body or a button, a fly or a floor, an arm or an apple. The sole     criterion for applying the idea to anything is merely that your eyes have     lighted on it. Make no attempt to include anything particular, but be sure     that nothing is specifically excluded.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><hr />  <p><br />Each of the first three lessons should not be done more than twice a day each, preferably morning and evening. Nor should they be attempted for more than a minute or so, unless that entails a sense of hurry. A comfortable sense of leisure is essential.<br /></p>		  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
