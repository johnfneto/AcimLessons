Besides the time you give morning and evening,     which should not be less than fifteen minutes, and the hourly remembrances     you make throughout the day, use the idea as often as you can between them.     Each of these ideas alone would be sufficient for salvation, if it were     learned truly. Each would be enough to give release to you and to the world     from every form of bondage, and invite the memory of God to come again. </p><p>With this in mind we start our practicing, in which we     carefully review the thoughts the Holy Spirit has bestowed on us in our     last twenty lessons. Each contains the whole curriculum if understood, practiced,     accepted, and applied to all the seeming happenings throughout the day.     One is enough. But from that one, there must be no exceptions made. And     so we need to use them all and let them blend as one, as each contributes     to the whole we learn. </p><p>These practice sessions, like our last review, are centered     round a central theme with which we start and end each lesson. It is this:&nbsp; </p>     <p><i>I am not a body. I am free.&nbsp; <br />          For I am still as God created me.&nbsp; </i></p><p>The day begins and ends with this. And we repeat it every time the hour strikes,     or we remember, in between, we have a function that transcends the world     we see. Beyond this, and a repetition of the special thought we practice     for the day, no form of exercise is urged, except a deep relinquishment     of everything that clutters up the mind, and makes it deaf to reason, sanity     and simple truth. </p><p>We will attempt to get beyond all words and special forms     of practicing for this review. For we attempt, this time, to reach a quickened     pace along a shorter path to the serenity and peace of God. We merely close     our eyes, and then forget all that we thought we knew and understood. For     thus is freedom given us from all we did not know and failed to understand. </p><p>There is but one exception to this lack of structuring.     Permit no idle thought to go unchallenged. If you notice one, deny its hold     and hasten to assure your mind that this is not what it would have. Then     gently let the thought which you denied be given up, in sure and quick exchange     for the idea we practice for the day. </p><p>When you are tempted, hasten to proclaim your freedom from temptation,     as you say:&nbsp; </p>     <p><i>This thought I do not want. I choose instead _____.&nbsp; </i></p><p>And then repeat the idea for the day, and let it take the place of what you     thought. Beyond such special applications of each day's idea, we will add     but a few formal expressions or specific thoughts to aid in practicing.     Instead, we give these times of quiet to the Teacher Who instructs in quiet,     speaks of peace, and gives our thoughts whatever meaning they may have. </p><p>To Him I offer this review for you. I place you in His charge, and let     Him teach you what to do and say and think, each time you turn to Him. He     will not fail to be available to you, each time you call to Him to help     you. Let us offer Him the whole review we now begin, and let us also not     forget to Whom it has been given, as we practice day by day, advancing toward     the goal He set for us; allowing Him to teach us how to go, and trusting     Him completely for the way each practice period can best become a loving     gift of freedom to the world.</p><hr /><p align="center"><b><a name="lesson_201" id="lesson_201"></a>Lesson 201</b></p><p align="center"><b>I     am not a body.
