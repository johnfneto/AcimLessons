			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 21</h3>    <p align="center"><b>I am determined to see things differently. </b></p><p> The idea for today is obviously a continuation and extension of the preceding     one. This time, however, specific mind-searching periods are necessary,     in addition to applying the idea to particular situations as they may arise.     Five practice periods are urged, allowing a full minute for each. </p><p> In the practice periods, begin by repeating the idea to yourself. Then close     your eyes and search your mind carefully for situations past, present or     anticipated that arouse anger in you. The anger may take the form of any     reaction ranging from mild irritation to rage. The degree of the emotion     you experience does not matter. You will become increasingly aware that     a slight twinge of annoyance is nothing but a veil drawn over intense fury. </p><p> Try, therefore, not to let the "little" thoughts of anger escape     you in the practice periods. Remember that you do not really recognize what     arouses anger in you, and nothing that you believe in this connection means     anything. You will probably be tempted to dwell more on some situations     or persons than on others, on the fallacious grounds that they are more "obvious." This     is not so. It is merely an example of the belief that some forms of attack     are more justified than others. </p><p> As you search your mind for all the forms in which attack thoughts present     themselves, hold each one in mind while you tell yourself: </p>     <p><i>I am determined to see ________ [name of person] differently.</i></p>     <p><i>I am determined to see ________ [specify the situation] differently. </i></p><p> Try to be as specific as possible. You may, for example, focus your anger     on a particular attribute of a particular person, believing that the anger     is limited to this aspect. If your perception is suffering from this form     of distortion, say: </p>     <p><i>I am determined to see ________ [specify the attribute] in <br />          ________          [name of person] differently. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
