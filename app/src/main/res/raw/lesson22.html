			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 22</h3>    <p align="center"><b>What I see is a form of vengeance. </b></p><p> Today's idea accurately describes the way anyone who holds attack thoughts     in his mind must see the world. Having projected his anger onto the world,     he sees vengeance about to strike at him. His own attack is thus perceived     as self defense. This becomes an increasingly vicious circle until he is     willing to change how he sees. Otherwise, thoughts of attack and counter-attack     will preoccupy him and people his entire world. What peace of mind is possible     to him then? </p><p> It is from this savage fantasy that you want to escape. Is it not joyous     news to hear that it is not real? Is it not a happy discovery to find that     you can escape? You made what you would destroy; everything that you hate     and would attack and kill. All that you fear does not exist. </p><p> Look at the world about you at least five times today, for at least a minute     each time.  As your eyes move slowly from one object to another, from one     body to another, say to yourself: </p>     <p><i> I see only the perishable. <br />          I see nothing that will last. <br />          What I see is not          real.<br />     </i><i>What I see is a form of vengeance. </i></p><p>At the end of each practice period, ask yourself: </p>     <p><i>Is this the world I really want to see? </i></p><p>The answer is surely obvious. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
