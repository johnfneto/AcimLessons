<h3 p align="center">Introduction</h3>
<p>Words will mean little now. We use them but as guides on which we do not     now depend. For now we seek direct experience of truth alone. The lessons     that remain are merely introductions to the times in which we leave the     world of pain, and go to enter peace. Now we begin to reach the goal this     course has set, and find the end toward which our practicing was always     geared. </p><p>Now we attempt to let the exercise be merely a beginning. For we wait in     quiet expectation for our God and Father. He has promised He will take the     final step Himself. And we are sure His promises are kept. We have come     far along the road, and now we wait for Him. We will continue spending time     with Him each morning and at night, as long as makes us happy. We will not     consider time a matter of duration now. We use as much as we will need for     the result that we desire. Nor will we forget our hourly remembrance in     between, calling to God when we have need of Him as we are tempted to forget     our goal. </p><p>We will continue with a central thought for all the days to come, and we     will use that thought to introduce our times of rest, and calm our minds     at need. Yet we will not content ourselves with simple practicing in the     remaining holy instants which conclude the year that we have given God.     We say some simple words of welcome, and expect our Father to reveal Himself,     as He has promised. We have called on Him, and He has promised that His     Son will not remain unanswered when he calls His Name. </p><p>Now do we come to Him with but His Word upon our minds and hearts, and     wait for Him to take the step to us that He has told us, through His Voice,     He would not fail to take when we invited Him. He has not left His Son in     all his madness, nor betrayed his trust in Him. Has not His faithfulness     earned Him the invitation that He seeks to make us happy? We will offer     it, and it will be accepted. So our times with Him will now be spent. We     say the words of invitation that His Voice suggests, and then we wait for     Him to come to us. </p><p>Now is the time of prophecy fulfilled. Now are all ancient promises upheld     and fully kept. No step remains for time to separate from its accomplishment.     For now we cannot fail. Sit silently and wait upon your Father. He has willed     to come to you when you have recognized it is your will He do so. And you     could have never come this far unless you saw, however dimly, that it is     your will. </p><p>I am so close to you we cannot fail. Father, we give these holy times to     You, in gratitude to Him Who taught us how to leave the world of sorrow     in exchange for its replacement, given us by You. We look not backward now.     We look ahead, and fix our eyes upon the journey's end. Accept these little     gifts of thanks from us, as through Christ's vision we behold a world beyond     the one we made, and take that world to be the full replacement of our own. </p><p>And now we wait in silence, unafraid and certain of Your coming. We have     sought to find our way by following the Guide You sent to us. We did not     know the way, but You did not forget us. And we know that You will not forget     us now. We ask but that Your ancient promises be kept which are Your Will     to keep. We will with You in asking this. The Father and the Son, Whose     holy Will created all that is, can fail in nothing. In this certainty, we     undertake these last few steps to You, and rest in confidence upon Your     Love, which will not fail the Son who calls to You. </p><p>And so we start upon the final part of this one holy year, which we have     spent together in the search for truth and God, Who is its one Creator.     We have found the way He chose for us, and made the choice to follow it     as He would have us go. His Hand has held us up. His Thoughts have lit the     darkness of our minds. His Love has called to us unceasingly since time     began. </p><p>We had a wish that God would fail to have the Son whom He created for Himself.     We wanted God to change Himself, and be what we would make of Him. And we     believed that our insane desires were the truth. Now we are glad that this     is all undone, and we no longer think illusions true. The memory of God     is shimmering across the wide horizons of our minds. A moment more, and     it will rise again. A moment more, and we who are God's Sons are safely     home, where He would have us be. </p><p>Now is the need for practice almost done. For in this final section, we     will come to understand that we need only call to God, and all temptations     disappear. Instead of words, we need but feel His Love. Instead of prayers,     we need but call His Name. Instead of judging, we need but be still and     let all things be healed. We will accept the way God's plan will end, as     we received the way it started. Now it is complete. This year has brought     us to eternity. </p><p>One further use for words we still retain. From time to time, instructions     on a theme of special relevance will intersperse our daily lessons and the     periods of wordless, deep experience which should come afterwards. These     special thoughts should be reviewed each day, each one of them to be continued     till the next is given you. They should be slowly read and thought about     a little while, preceding one of the holy and blessed instants in the day.     We give the first of these instructions now. </p><hr /><p align="center"></p><p align="center">
<h3 p align="center">1. What is Forgiveness?</h3> <p>Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not     occurred. It does not pardon sins and make them real. It sees there was     no sin. And in that view are all your sins forgiven. What is sin, except     a false idea about God's Son? Forgiveness merely sees its falsity, and therefore     lets it go. What then is free to take its place is now the Will of God. </p><p>An unforgiving thought is one which makes a judgment that it will not raise     to doubt, although it is not true. The mind is closed, and will not be released.     The thought protects projection, tightening its chains, so that distortions     are more veiled and more obscure; less easily accessible to doubt, and further     kept from reason. What can come between a fixed projection and the aim that     it has chosen as its wanted goal? </p><p>An unforgiving thought does many things. In frantic action it pursues its     goal, twisting and overturning what it sees as interfering with its chosen     path. Distortion is its purpose, and the means by which it would accomplish     it as well. It sets about its furious attempts to smash reality, without     concern for anything that would appear to pose a contradiction to its point     of view. </p><p>Forgiveness, on the other hand, is still, and quietly does nothing. It     offends no aspect of reality, nor seeks to twist it to appearances it likes.     It merely looks, and waits, and judges not. He who would not forgive must     judge, for he must justify his failure to forgive. But he who would forgive     himself must learn to welcome truth exactly as it is. </p><p>Do nothing, then, and let forgiveness show you what to do, through Him     Who is your Guide, your Savior and Protector, strong in hope, and certain     of your ultimate success. He has forgiven you already, for such is His function,     given Him by God. Now must you share His function, and forgive whom He has     saved, whose sinlessness He sees, and whom He honors as the Son of God. </p><hr /><p></p><p align="center"><a name="lesson_221" id="lesson_221"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 221</h3></p><p align="center"><b>Peace     to my mind.&nbsp; Let all my thoughts be still.</b></p><p><i> Father, I come to You today to seek the peace that You alone can give. I     come in silence. In the quiet of my heart, the deep recesses of my mind,     I wait and listen for Your Voice. My Father, speak to me today. I come to     hear Your Voice in silence and in certainty and love, sure You will hear     my call and answer me. </i></p><p> Now do we wait in quiet. God is here, because we wait together. I am sure     that He will speak to you, and you will hear. Accept my confidence, for     it is yours. Our minds are joined. We wait with one intent; to hear our     Father's answer to our call, to let our thoughts be still and find His peace,     to hear Him speak to us of what we are, and to reveal Himself unto His Son.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p>
