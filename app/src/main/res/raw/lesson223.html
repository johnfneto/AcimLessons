I have no life but His. </b></p><p> I was mistaken when I thought I lived apart from God, a separate entity that     moved in isolation, unattached, and housed within a body. Now I know my     life is God's, I have no other home, and I do not exist apart from Him.     He has no Thoughts that are not part of me, and I have none but those which     are of Him. </p><p><i> Our Father, let us see the face of Christ instead of our mistakes. For we     who are Your holy Son are sinless. We would look upon our sinlessness, for     guilt proclaims that we are not Your Son. And we would not forget You longer.     We are lonely here, and long for Heaven, where we are at home. Today we     would return. Our Name is Yours, and we acknowledge that we are Your Son.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
