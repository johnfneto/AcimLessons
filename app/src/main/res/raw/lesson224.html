It lights the world as well. It is the gift my Father gave to me; the one     as well I give the world. There is no gift but this that can be either given     or received. This is reality, and only this. This is illusion's end. It     is the truth. </p><p><i> My Name, O Father, still is known to You. I have forgotten It, and do not     know where I am going, who I am, or what it is I do. Remind me, Father,     now, for I am weary of the world I see. Reveal what You would have me see     instead.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
