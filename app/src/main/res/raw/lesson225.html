I must return it, for I want     it mine in full awareness, blazing in my mind and keeping it within its     kindly light, inviolate, beloved, with fear behind and only peace ahead.     How still the way Your loving Son is led along to You! </i></p><p> Brother, we find that stillness now. The way is open. Now we follow it in     peace together. You have reached your hand to me, and I will never leave     you. We are one, and it is but this oneness that we seek, as we accomplish     these few final steps which end a journey that was not begun.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
