It is not death which makes     this possible, but it is change of mind about the purpose of the world.     If I believe it has a value as I see it now, so will it still remain for     me. But if I see no value in the world as I behold it, nothing that I want     to keep as mine or search for as a goal, it will depart from me. For I have     not sought for illusions to replace the truth. </p><p><i> Father, my home awaits my glad return. Your Arms are open and I hear Your     Voice. What need have I to linger in a place of vain desires and of shattered     dreams, when Heaven can so easily be mine?</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
