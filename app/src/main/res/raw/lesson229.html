Now need I seek no more. Love has prevailed. So     still It waited for my coming home, that I will turn away no longer from     the holy face of Christ. And what I look upon attests the truth of the Identity     I sought to lose, but which my Father has kept safe for me. </p><p><i> Father, my thanks to You for what I am; for keeping my Identity untouched     and sinless, in the midst of all the thoughts of sin my foolish mind made     up. And thanks to You for saving me from them. Amen.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
