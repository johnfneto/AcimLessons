And in peace do I remain. It is not given me to change     my Self. How merciful is God my Father, that when He created me He gave     me peace forever. Now I ask but to be what I am. And can this be denied     me, when it is forever true? </p><p class="style1"> Father, I seek the peace You gave as mine in my creation.     What was given then must be here now, for my creation was apart from time,     and still remains beyond all change. The peace in which Your Son was born     into Your Mind is shining there unchanged. I am as You created me. I need     but call on You to find the peace You gave. It is Your Will that gave it     to Your Son.  </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
