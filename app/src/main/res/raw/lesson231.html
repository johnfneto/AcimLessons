 <p>Salvation is a promise, made by God, that you would find your way to Him     at last.&nbsp; It cannot but be kept.&nbsp; It guarantees that time will     have an end, and all the thoughts that have been born in time will end as     well.&nbsp; God's Word is given every mind which thinks that it has separate     thoughts, and will replace these thoughts of conflict with the Thought of     peace.</p><p>The Thought of peace was given to God's Son the instant that his mind had     thought of war.&nbsp; There was no need for such a Thought before, for peace     was given without opposite, and merely was.&nbsp; But when the mind is split     there is a need of healing.&nbsp; So the Thought that has the power to heal     the split became a part of every fragment of the mind that still was one,     but failed to recognize its oneness.&nbsp; Now it did not know itself, and     thought its own Identity was lost.</p><p>Salvation is undoing in the sense that it does nothing, failing to support     the world of dreams and malice.&nbsp; Thus it lets illusions go.&nbsp; By     not supporting them, it merely lets them quietly go down to dust.&nbsp; And     what they hid is now revealed; an altar to the holy Name of God whereon     His Word is written, with the gifts of your forgiveness laid before it,     and the memory of God not far behind.</p><p>Let us come daily to this holy place, and spend a while together.&nbsp; Here     we share our final dream.&nbsp; It is a dream in which there is no sorrow,     for it holds a hint of all the glory given us by God. The grass is pushing     through the soil, the trees are budding now, and birds have come to live     within their branches.&nbsp; Earth is being born again in new perspective.&nbsp; Night     has gone, and we have come together in the light.</p><p>From here we give salvation to the world, for it is here salvation was     received.&nbsp; The song of our rejoicing is the call to all the world that     freedom is returned, that time is almost over, and God's Son has but an     instant more to wait until his Father is remembered, dreams are done, eternity     has shined away the world, and only Heaven now exists at all.</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_231" id="lesson_231"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 231</h3></p><p align="center"><b>Father,     I will but to remember You. </b></p><p><i> What can I seek for, Father, but Your Love? Perhaps I think I seek for something     else; a something I have called by many names. Yet is Your Love the only     thing I seek, or ever sought. For there is nothing else that I could ever     really want to find. Let me remember You. What else could I desire but the     truth about myself? </i></p><p> This is your will, my brother. And you share this will with me, and with     the One as well Who is our Father. To remember Him is Heaven. This we seek.     And only this is what it will be given us to find.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
