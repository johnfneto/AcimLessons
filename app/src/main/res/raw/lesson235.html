I need but keep in mind my Father's Will for me is     only happiness, to find that only happiness has come to me. And I need but     remember that God's Love surrounds His Son and keeps his sinlessness forever     perfect, to be sure that I am saved and safe forever in His Arms. I am the     Son He loves. And I am saved because God in His mercy wills it so. </p><p><i> Father, Your Holiness is mine. Your Love created me, and made my sinlessness     forever part of You. I have no guilt nor sin in me, for there is none in     You.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p> </p>
