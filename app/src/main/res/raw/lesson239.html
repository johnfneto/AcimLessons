Let     us instead be thankful for the gifts our Father gave us. Can we see in those     with whom He shares His glory any trace of sin and guilt? And can it be     that we are not among them, when He loves His Son forever and with perfect     constancy, knowing he is as He created him? </p><p><i> We thank You, Father, for the light that shines forever in us. And we honor     it, because You share it with us. We are one, united in this light and one     with You, at peace with all creation and ourselves.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
