Therefore, you have no guide to appropriate action, and no way of     judging the result. What you do is determined by your perception of the     situation, and that perception is wrong. It is inevitable, then, that you     will not serve your own best interests. Yet they are your only goal in any     situation which is correctly perceived. Otherwise, you will not recognize     what they are. </p><p> If you realized that you do not perceive your own best interests, you could     be taught what they are. But in the presence of your conviction that you     do know what they are, you cannot learn. The idea for today is a step toward     opening your mind so that learning can begin. </p><p> The exercises for today require much more honesty than you are accustomed     to using. A few subjects, honestly and carefully considered in each of the     five practice periods which should be undertaken today, will be more helpful     than a more cursory examination of a large number. Two minutes are suggested     for each of the mind-searching periods which the exercises involve. </p><p> The practice periods should begin with repeating today's idea, followed by     searching the mind, with closed eyes, for unresolved situations about which     you are currently concerned. The emphasis should be on uncovering the outcome     you want. You will quickly realize that you have a number of goals in mind     as part of the desired outcome, and also that these goals are on different     levels and often conflict. </p><p> In applying the idea for today, name each situation that occurs to you, and     then enumerate carefully as many goals as possible that you would like to     be met in its resolution. The form of each application should be roughly     as follows: </p>     <p><i> In the situation involving ______, I would like ______      to happen, and ______ to happen, </i></p><p>and so on. Try to cover as many different kinds of outcomes as may honestly     occur to you, even if some of them do not appear to be directly related     to the situation, or even to be inherent in it at all. </p><p> If these exercises are done properly, you will quickly recognize that you     are making a large number of demands of the situation which have nothing     to do with it. You will also recognize that many of your goals are contradictory,     that you have no unified outcome in mind, and that you must experience disappointment     in connection with some of your goals, however the situation turns out. </p><p> After covering the list of as many hoped-for goals as possible, for each     unresolved situation that crosses your mind say to yourself: </p>     <p><i>I do not perceive my own best interests in this situation, </i></p><p>and go on to the next one. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
