It attests that you have seen yourself as you could never     be, and therefore look upon a world which is impossible. Not one thing in     this world is true. It does not matter what the form in which it may appear.     It witnesses but to your own illusions of yourself. Let us not be deceived     today. We are the Sons of God. There is no fear in us, for we are each a     part of Love Itself. </p><p><i> How foolish are our fears! Would You allow Your Son to suffer? Give us faith     today to recognize Your Son, and set him free. Let us forgive him in Your     Name, that we may understand his holiness, and feel the love for him which     is Your Own as well.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
