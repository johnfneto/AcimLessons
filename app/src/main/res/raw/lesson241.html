<p>The world is false perception. It is born of error, and it has not left     its source. It will remain no longer than the thought that gave it birth     is cherished. When the thought of separation has been changed to one of     true forgiveness, will the world be seen in quite another light; and one     which leads to truth, where all the world must disappear and all its errors     vanish. Now its source has gone, and its effects are gone as well. </p><p>The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is     fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where     God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him. Here was     perception born, for knowledge could not cause such insane thoughts. But     eyes deceive, and ears hear falsely. Now mistakes become quite possible,     for certainty has gone. </p><p>The mechanisms of illusion have been born instead. And now they go to find     what has been given them to seek. Their aim is to fulfill the purpose which     the world was made to witness and make real. They see in its illusions but     a solid base where truth exists, upheld apart from lies. Yet everything     that they report is but illusion which is kept apart from truth. </p><p>As sight was made to lead away from truth, it can be redirected. Sounds     become the call for God, and all perception can be given a new purpose by     the One Whom God appointed Savior to the world. Follow His light, and see     the world as He beholds it. Hear His Voice alone in all that speaks to you.     And let Him give you peace and certainty, which you have thrown away, but     Heaven has preserved for you in Him. </p><p>Let us not rest content until the world has joined our changed perception.     Let us not be satisfied until forgiveness has been made complete. And let     us not attempt to change our function. We must save the world. For we who     made it must behold it through the eyes of Christ, that what was made to     die can be restored to everlasting life.</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_241" id="lesson_241"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 241</h3></p><p align="center"><b>This     holy instant is salvation come. </b></p><p> What joy there is today! It is a time of special celebration. For today holds     out the instant to the darkened world where its release is set. The day     has come when sorrows pass away and pain is gone. The glory of salvation     dawns today upon a world set free. This is the time of hope for countless     millions. They will be united now, as you forgive them all. For I will be     forgiven by you today. </p><p><i> We have forgiven one another now, and so we come at last to You again. Father,     Your Son, who never left, returns to Heaven and his home. How glad are we     to have our sanity restored to us, and to remember that we all are one.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
