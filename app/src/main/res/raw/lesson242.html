It is my gift to Him. </b></p><p> I will not lead my life alone today. I do not understand the world, and so     to try to lead my life alone must be but foolishness. But there is One Who     knows all that is best for me. And He is glad to make no choices for me     but the ones that lead to God. I give this day to Him, for I would not delay     my coming home, and it is He Who knows the way to God. </p><p class="style1"> And so we give today to You. We come with wholly open minds. We do not ask     for anything that we may think we want. Give us what You would have received     by us. You know all our desires and our wants. And You will give us everything     we need in helping us to find the way to You.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
