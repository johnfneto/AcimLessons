I will not think that I already know     what must remain beyond my present grasp. I will not think I understand     the whole from bits of my perception, which are all that I can see. Today     I recognize that this is so. And so I am relieved of judgments that I cannot     make. Thus do I free myself and what I look upon, to be in peace as God     created us. </p><p><i> Father, today I leave creation free to be itself. I honor all its parts,     in which I am included. We are one because each part contains Your memory,     and truth must shine in all of us as one.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
