He need     but call upon Your Name, and he will recollect his safety and Your Love,     for they are one. How can he fear or doubt or fail to know he cannot suffer,     be endangered, or experience unhappiness, when he belongs to You, beloved     and loving, in the safety of Your Fatherly embrace? </i></p><p> And there we are in truth. No storms can come into the hallowed haven of     our home. In God we are secure. For what can come to threaten God Himself,     or make afraid what will forever be a part of Him?</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
