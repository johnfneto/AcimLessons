Attack is gone, and madness has an     end. What suffering is now conceivable? What loss can be sustained? The     world becomes a place of joy, abundance, charity and endless giving. It     is now so like to Heaven that it quickly is transformed into the light that     it reflects. And so the journey which the Son of God began has ended in     the light from which he came. </p><p><i> Father, we would return our minds to You. We have betrayed them, held them     in a vise of bitterness, and frightened them with thoughts of violence and     death. Now would we rest again in You, as You created us.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
