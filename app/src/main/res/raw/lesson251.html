<p>Sin is insanity. It is the means by which the mind is driven mad, and seeks     to let illusions take the place of truth. And being mad, it sees illusions     where the truth should be, and where it really is. Sin gave the body eyes,     for what is there the sinless would behold? What need have they of sights     or sounds or touch? What would they hear or reach to grasp? What would they     sense at all? To sense is not to know. And truth can be but filled with     knowledge, and with nothing else. </p><p>The body is the instrument the mind made in its efforts to deceive itself.     Its purpose is to strive. Yet can the goal of striving change. And now the     body serves a different aim for striving. What it seeks for now is chosen     by the aim the mind has taken as replacement for the goal of self-deception.     Truth can be its aim as well as lies. The senses then will seek instead     for witnesses to what is true. </p><p>Sin is the home of all illusions, which but stand for things imagined,     issuing from thoughts that are untrue. They are the "proof" that     what has no reality is real. Sin "proves" God's Son is evil; timelessness     must have an end; eternal life must die. And God Himself has lost the Son     He loves, with but corruption to complete Himself, His Will forever overcome     by death, love slain by hate, and peace to be no more. </p><p>A madman's dreams are frightening, and sin appears indeed to terrify. And     yet what sin perceives is but a childish game. The Son of God may play he     has become a body, prey to evil and to guilt, with but a little life that     ends in death. But all the while his Father shines on him, and loves him     with an everlasting Love which his pretenses cannot change at all. </p><p>How long, O Son of God, will you maintain the game of sin? Shall we not     put away these sharp-edged children's toys? How soon will you be ready to     come home? Perhaps today? There is no sin. Creation is unchanged. Would     you still hold return to Heaven back? How long, O holy Son of God, how long?</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_251" id="lesson_251"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 251</h3></p><p align="center"><b>I     am in need of nothing but the truth. </b></p><p> I sought for many things, and found despair. Now do I seek but one, for in     that one is all I need, and only what I need. All that I sought before I     needed not, and did not even want. My only need I did not recognize. But     now I see that I need only truth. In that all needs are satisfied, all cravings     end, all hopes are finally fulfilled and dreams are gone. Now have I everything     that I could need. Now have I everything that I could want. And now at last     I find myself at peace. </p><p><i> And for that peace, our Father, we give thanks. What we denied ourselves     You have restored, and only that is what we really want.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
