Its shimmering and perfect purity is far more brilliant than is any light     that I have ever looked upon. Its love is limitless, with an intensity that     holds all things within it, in the calm of quiet certainty. Its strength     comes not from burning impulses which move the world, but from the boundless     Love of God Himself. How far beyond this world my Self must be, and yet     how near to me and close to God! </p><p><i> Father, You know my true Identity. Reveal It now to me who am Your Son, that     I may waken to the truth in You, and know that Heaven is restored to me.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
