Even     in this world, it is I who rule my destiny. What happens is what I desire.     What does not occur is what I do not want to happen. This must I accept.     For thus am I led past this world to my creations, children of my will,     in Heaven where my holy Self abides with them and Him Who has created me. </p><p><i> You are the Self Whom You created Son, creating like Yourself and One with     You. My Self, which rules the universe, is but Your Will in perfect union     with my own, which can but offer glad assent to Yours, that it may be extended     to Itself.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
