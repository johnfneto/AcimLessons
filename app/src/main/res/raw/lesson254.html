In deepest silence I would come     to You, to hear Your Voice and to receive Your Word. I have no prayer but     this: I come to You to ask You for the truth. And truth is but Your Will,     which I would share with You today. </i></p><p> Today we let no ego thoughts direct our words or actions. When such thoughts     occur, we quietly step back and look at them, and then we let them go. We     do not want what they would bring with them. And so we do not choose to     keep them. They are silent now. And in the stillness, hallowed by His Love,     God speaks to us and tells us of our will, as we have chosen to remember     Him.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
