And yet,     my God assures me that His Son is like Himself. Let me this day have faith     in Him Who says I am God's Son. And let the peace I choose be mine today     bear witness to the truth of what He says. God's Son can have no cares,     and must remain forever in the peace of Heaven. In His Name, I give today     to finding what my Father wills for me, accepting it as mine, and giving     it to all my Father's Sons, along with me. </p><p><i> And so, my Father, would I pass this day with You. Your Son has not forgotten     You. The peace You gave him still is in his mind, and it is there I choose     to spend today.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
