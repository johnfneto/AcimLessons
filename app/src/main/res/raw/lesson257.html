No one can serve contradicting goals and serve     them well. Nor can he function without deep distress and great depression.     Let us therefore be determined to remember what we want today, that we may     unify our thoughts and actions meaningfully, and achieve only what God would     have us do this day. </p><p class="style1"> Father, forgiveness is Your chosen means for our salvation. Let us not forget     today that we can have no will but Yours. And thus our purpose must be Yours     as well, if we would reach the peace You will for us.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
