His memory is hidden in our     minds, obscured but by our pointless little goals which offer nothing, and     do not exist. Shall we continue to allow God's grace to shine in unawareness,     while the toys and trinkets of the world are sought instead? God is our     only goal, our only Love. We have no aim but to remember Him. </p><p class="style1"> Our goal is but to follow in the way that leads to You. We have no goal but     this. What could we want but to remember You? What could we seek but our     Identity?</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
