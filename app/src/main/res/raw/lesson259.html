What     else could blind us to the obvious, and make the strange and the distorted     seem more clear? What else but sin engenders our attacks? What else but     sin could be the source of guilt, demanding punishment and suffering? And     what but sin could be the source of fear, obscuring God's creation; giving     love the attributes of fear and of attack? </p><p><i> Father, I would not be insane today. I would not be afraid of love, nor seek     for refuge in its opposite. For love can have no opposite. You are the Source     of everything there is. And everything that is remains with You, and You     with it.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
