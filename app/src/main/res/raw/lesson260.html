Yet,     as Your Thought, I have not left my Source, remaining part of Who created     me. Your Son, my Father, calls on You today. Let me remember You created     me. Let me remember my Identity. And let my sinlessness arise again before     Christ's vision, through which I would look upon my brothers and myself     today. </i></p><p> Now is our Source remembered, and Therein we find our true Identity at last.     Holy indeed are we, because our Source can know no sin. And we who are His     Sons are like each other, and alike to Him. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
