<p>The body is a fence the Son of God imagines he has built, to separate parts     of his Self from other parts. It is within this fence he thinks he lives,     to die as it decays and crumbles. For within this fence he thinks that he     is safe from love. Identifying with his safety, he regards himself as what     his safety is. How else could he be certain he remains within the body,     keeping love outside? </p><p>The body will not stay. Yet this he sees as double safety. For the Son     of God's impermanence is "proof" his fences work, and do the task     his mind assigns to them. For if his oneness still remained untouched, who     could attack and who could be attacked? Who could be victor? Who could be     his prey? Who could be victim? Who the murderer? And if he did not die,     what "proof" is there that God's eternal Son can be destroyed? </p><p>The body is a dream. Like other dreams it sometimes seems to picture happiness,     but can quite suddenly revert to fear, where every dream is born. For only     love creates in truth, and truth can never fear. Made to be fearful, must     the body serve the purpose given it. But we can change the purpose that     the body will obey by changing what we think that it is for. </p><p>The body is the means by which God's Son returns to sanity. Though it was     made to fence him into hell without escape, yet has the goal of Heaven been     exchanged for the pursuit of hell. The Son of God extends his hand to reach     his brother, and to help him walk along the road with him. Now is the body     holy. Now it serves to heal the mind that it was made to kill. </p><p>You will identify with what you think will make you safe. Whatever it may     be, you will believe that it is one with you. Your safety lies in truth,     and not in lies. Love is your safety. Fear does not exist. Identify with     love, and you are safe. Identify with love, and you are home. Identify with     love, and find your Self.</p><hr /><p align="center"></p><p align="center"><a name="lesson_261" id="lesson_261"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 261</h3></p><p align="center"><b>God     is my refuge and security. </b></p><p> I will identify with what I think is refuge and security. I will behold myself     where I perceive my strength, and think I live within the citadel where     I am safe and cannot be attacked. Let me today seek not security in danger,     nor attempt to find my peace in murderous attack. I live in God. In Him     I find my refuge and my strength. In Him is my Identity. In Him is everlasting     peace. And only there will I remember Who I really am. </p><p><i> Let me not seek for idols. I would come, my Father, home to You today. I     choose to be as You created me, and find the Son whom You created as my     Self.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
