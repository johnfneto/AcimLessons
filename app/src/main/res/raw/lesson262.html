And it is he that I would look upon today. He is     Your one creation. Why should I perceive a thousand forms in what remains     as one? Why should I give this one a thousand names, when only one suffices?     For Your Son must bear Your Name, for You created him. Let me not see him     as a stranger to his Father, nor as stranger to myself. For he is part of     me and I of him, and we are part of You Who are our Source, eternally united     in Your Love; eternally the holy Son of God. </i></p><p> We who are one would recognize this day the truth about ourselves. We would     come home, and rest in unity. For there is peace, and nowhere else can peace     be sought and found.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
