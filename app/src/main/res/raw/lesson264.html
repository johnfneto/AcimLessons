You are in all the things I look upon, the sounds I     hear, and every hand that reaches for my own. In You time disappears, and     place becomes a meaningless belief. For what surrounds Your Son and keeps     him safe is Love itself. There is no source but this, and nothing is that     does not share its holiness; that stands beyond Your one creation, or without     the Love which holds all things within itself. Father, Your Son is like     Yourself. We come to You in Your Own Name today, to be at peace within Your     everlasting Love. </i></p><p> My brothers, join with me in this today. This is salvation's prayer. Must     we not join in what will save the world, along with us?</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
