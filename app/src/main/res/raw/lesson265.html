How fierce they seemed! And how deceived was I     to think that what I feared was in the world, instead of in my mind alone.     Today I see the world in the celestial gentleness with which creation shines.     There is no fear in it. Let no appearance of my sins obscure the light of     Heaven shining on the world. What is reflected there is in God's Mind. The     images I see reflect my thoughts. Yet is my mind at one with God's.  And     so I can perceive creation's gentleness. </p><p><i> In quiet would I look upon the world, which but reflects Your Thoughts, and     mine as well. Let me remember that they are the same, and I will see creation's     gentleness.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
