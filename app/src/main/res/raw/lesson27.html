			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 27</h3>    <p align="center"><b>Above all else I want to see. </b></p><p> Today's idea expresses something stronger than mere determination. It gives     vision priority among your desires. You may feel hesitant about using the     idea, on the grounds that you are not sure you really mean it. This does     not matter. The purpose of today's exercises is to bring the time when the     idea will be wholly true a little nearer. </p><p> There may be a great temptation to believe that some sort of sacrifice is     being asked of you when you say you want to see above all else. If you become     uneasy about the lack of reservation involved, add: </p>     <p><i>Vision has no cost to anyone. </i></p><p>If fear of loss still persists, add further: </p>     <p><i>It can only bless. </i></p><p> The idea for today needs many repetitions for maximum benefit. It should     be used at least every half hour, and more if possible. You might try for     every fifteen or twenty minutes. It is recommended that you set a definite     time interval for using the idea when you wake or shortly afterwards, and     attempt to adhere to it throughout the day. It will not be difficult to     do this, even if you are engaged in conversation, or otherwise occupied     at the time. You can still repeat one short sentence to yourself without     disturbing anything. </p><p> The real question is, how often will you remember? How much do you want today's     idea to be true? Answer one of these questions, and you have answered the     other. You will probably miss several applications, and perhaps quite a     number. Do not be disturbed by this, but do try to keep on your schedule     from then on. If only once during the day you feel that you were perfectly     sincere while you were repeating today's idea, you can be sure that you     have saved yourself many years of effort. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
