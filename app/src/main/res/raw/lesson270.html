How     glorious and gracious is this world! Yet how much more will I perceive in     it than sight can give. The world forgiven signifies Your Son acknowledges     his Father, lets his dreams be brought to truth, and waits expectantly the     one remaining instant more of time which ends forever, as Your memory returns     to him. And now his will is one with Yours. His function now is but Your     Own, and every thought except Your Own is gone. </i></p><p> The quiet of today will bless our hearts, and through them peace will come     to everyone. Christ is our eyes today. And through His sight we offer healing     to the world through Him, the holy Son whom God created whole; the holy     Son whom God created One. &nbsp;</p>
