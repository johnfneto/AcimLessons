Let me not fear. </b></p><p class="style1"> Father, today I would let all things be as You created them, and give Your     Son the honor due his sinlessness; the love of brother to his brother and     his Friend. Through this I am redeemed. Through this as well the truth will     enter where illusions were, light will replace all darkness, and Your Son     will know he is as You created him. </p><p> A special blessing comes to us today, from Him Who is our Father. Give this     day to Him, and there will be no fear today, because the day is given unto     love.</p>
