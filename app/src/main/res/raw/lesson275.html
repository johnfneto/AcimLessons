Yet has this day been chosen as the     time when we will seek and hear and learn and understand. Join me in hearing.     For the Voice for God tells us of things we cannot understand alone, nor     learn apart. It is in this that all things are protected. And in this the     healing of the Voice for God is found. </p><p><i> Your healing Voice protects all things today, and so I leave all things to     You. I need be anxious over nothing. For Your Voice will tell me what to     do and where to go; to whom to speak and what to say to him, what thoughts     to think, what words to give the world. The safety that I bring is given     me. Father, Your Voice protects all things through me.</i></p>
