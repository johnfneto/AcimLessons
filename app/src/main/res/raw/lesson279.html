Only in dreams is there a time when he appears to be in prison, and     awaits a future freedom, if it be at all. Yet in reality his dreams are     gone, with truth established in their place. And now is freedom his already.     Should I wait in chains which have been severed for release, when God is     offering me freedom now? </p><p><i> I will accept Your promises today, and give my faith to them. My Father loves     the Son Whom He created as His Own. Would You withhold the gifts You gave     to me?</i></p>
