Since He must     bridge the gap between reality and dreams, perception leads to knowledge     through the grace that God has given Him, to be His gift to everyone who     turns to Him for truth. Across the bridge that He provides are dreams all     carried to the truth, to be dispelled before the light of knowledge. There     are sights and sounds forever laid aside. And where they were perceived     before, forgiveness has made possible perception's tranquil end. </p><p>The goal the Holy Spirit's teaching sets is just this end of dreams. For     sights and sounds must be translated from the witnesses of fear to those     of love. And when this is entirely accomplished, learning has achieved the     only goal it has in truth. For learning, as the Holy Spirit guides it to     the outcome He perceives for it, becomes the means to go beyond itself,     to be replaced by the eternal truth. </p><p>If you but knew how much your Father yearns to have you recognize your     sinlessness, you would not let His Voice appeal in vain, nor turn away from     His replacement for the fearful images and dreams you made. The Holy Spirit     understands the means you made, by which you would attain what is forever     unattainable. And if you offer them to Him, He will employ the means you     made for exile to restore your mind to where it truly is at home. </p><p>From knowledge, where He has been placed by God, the Holy Spirit calls     to you, to let forgiveness rest upon your dreams, and be restored to sanity     and peace of mind. Without forgiveness will your dreams remain to terrify     you. And the memory of all your Father's Love will not return to signify     the end of dreams has come. </p><p>Accept your Father's gift. It is a Call from Love to Love, that It be but     Itself. The Holy Spirit is His gift, by which the quietness of Heaven is     restored to God's beloved Son. Would you refuse to take the function of     completing God, when all He wills is that you be complete?</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_281" id="lesson_281"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 281</h3></p><p align="center"><b>I can be hurt by nothing but my thoughts. </b></p><p><i> Father, Your Son is perfect. When I think that I am hurt in any way, it is     because I have forgotten who I am, and that I am as You created me. Your     Thoughts can only bring me happiness. If ever I am sad or hurt or ill, I     have forgotten what You think, and put my little meaningless ideas in place     of where Your Thoughts belong, and where they are. I can be hurt by nothing     but my thoughts. The Thoughts I think with You can only bless. The Thoughts     I think with You alone are true. </i></p><p> I will not hurt myself today. For I am far beyond all pain. My Father placed     me safe in Heaven, watching over me. And I would not attack the Son He loves,     for what He loves is also mine to love.</p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
