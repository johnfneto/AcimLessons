This the decision not to be insane, and to accept myself as God Himself,     my Father and my Source, created me. This the determination not to be asleep     in dreams of death, while truth remains forever living in the joy of love.     And this the choice to recognize the Self Whom God created as the Son He     loves, and Who remains my one Identity. </p><p><i> Father, Your Name is Love and so is mine. Such is the truth. And can the     truth be changed by merely giving it another name? The name of fear is simply     a mistake. Let me not be afraid of truth today.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
