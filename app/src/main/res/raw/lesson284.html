Pain is impossible. There is no     grief with any cause at all. And suffering of any kind is nothing but a     dream. This is the truth, at first to be but said and then repeated many     times; and next to be accepted as but partly true, with many reservations.     Then to be considered seriously more and more, and finally accepted as the     truth. I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt. And I would go beyond     these words today, and past all reservations, and arrive at full acceptance     of the truth in them. </p><p><i> Father, what You have given cannot hurt, so grief and pain must be impossible.     Let me not fail to trust in You today, accepting but the joyous as Your     gifts; accepting but the joyous as the truth.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
