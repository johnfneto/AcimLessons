I ask but them to come, and realize my invitation will be answered by the     thoughts to which it has been sent by me. And I will ask for only joyous     things the instant I accept my holiness. For what would be the use of pain     to me, what purpose would my suffering fulfill, and how would grief and     loss avail me if insanity departs from me today, and I accept my holiness     instead? </p><p><i> Father, my holiness is Yours. Let me rejoice in it, and through forgiveness     be restored to sanity. Your Son is still as You created him. My holiness     is part of me, and also part of You. And what can alter Holiness Itself?</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
