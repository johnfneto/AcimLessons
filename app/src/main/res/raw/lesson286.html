How quietly do all things fall in place! This is     the day that has been chosen as the time in which I come to understand the     lesson that there is no need that I do anything. In You is every choice     already made. In You has every conflict been resolved. In You is everything     I hope to find already given me. Your peace is mine. My heart is quiet,     and my mind at rest. Your Love is Heaven, and Your Love is mine. </i></p><p> The stillness of today will give us hope that we have found the way, and     travelled far along it to a wholly certain goal. Today we will not doubt     the end which God Himself has promised us. We trust in Him, and in our Self,     Who still is One with Him.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
