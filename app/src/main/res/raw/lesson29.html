			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 29</h3>    <p align="center"><b>God is in everything I see. </b></p><p> The idea for today explains why you can see all purpose in everything. It     explains why nothing is separate, by itself or in itself. And it explains     why nothing you see means anything. In fact, it explains every idea we have     used thus far, and all subsequent ones as well. Today's idea is the whole     basis for vision. </p><p> You will probably find this idea very difficult to grasp at this point. You     may find it silly, irreverent, senseless, funny and even objectionable.     Certainly God is not in a table, for example, as you see it. Yet we emphasized     yesterday that a table shares the purpose of the universe. And what shares     the purpose of the universe shares the purpose of its Creator. </p><p> Try then, today, to begin to learn how to look on all things with love, appreciation     and open-mindedness. You do not see them now. Would you know what is in     them? Nothing is as it appears to you. Its holy purpose stands beyond your     little range. When vision has shown you the holiness that lights up the     world, you will understand today's idea perfectly. And you will not understand     how you could ever have found it difficult. </p><p> Our six two-minute practice periods for today should follow a now familiar     pattern: Begin with repeating the idea to yourself, and then apply it to     randomly chosen subjects about you, naming each one specifically. Try to     avoid the tendency toward self-directed selection, which may be particularly     tempting in connection with today's idea because of its wholly alien nature.     Remember that any order you impose is equally alien to reality. </p><p> Your list of subjects should therefore be as free of self-selection as possible.     For example, a suitable list might include: </p>     <p><i>God is in this coat hanger. <br />          God is in this magazine. <br />          God is in this finger.          <br />          God is in this lamp. <br />          God is in that body. <br />          God is in that door. <br />          God is in          that waste basket. </i></p><p>In addition to the assigned practice periods, repeat the idea for today at     least once an hour, looking slowly about you as you say the words unhurriedly     to yourself.  At least once or twice, you should experience a sense of     restfulness as you do this. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
