Eyes that begin to open see at last. And I would have Christ's vision come     to me this very day. What I perceive without God's Own Correction for the     sight I made is frightening and painful to behold. Yet I would not allow     my mind to be deceived by the belief the dream I made is real an instant     longer. This the day I seek my present happiness, and look on nothing else     except the thing I seek. </p><p><i> With this resolve I come to You, and ask Your strength to hold me up today,     while I but seek to do Your Will. You cannot fail to hear me, Father. What     I ask have You already given me. And I am sure that I will see my happiness     today. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
