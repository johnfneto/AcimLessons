Yet     it stands for what is opposite to what you made. Your world is seen through     eyes of fear, and brings the witnesses of terror to your mind. The real     world cannot be perceived except through eyes forgiveness blesses, so they     see a world where terror is impossible, and witnesses to fear can not be     found. </p><p>The real world holds a counterpart for each unhappy thought reflected in     your world; a sure correction for the sights of fear and sounds of battle     which your world contains. The real world shows a world seen differently,     through quiet eyes and with a mind at peace. Nothing but rest is there.     There are no cries of pain and sorrow heard, for nothing there remains outside     forgiveness. And the sights are gentle. Only happy sights and sounds can     reach the mind that has forgiven itself. </p><p>What need has such a mind for thoughts of death, attack and murder? What     can it perceive surrounding it but safety, love and joy? What is there it     would choose to be condemned, and what is there that it would judge against?     The world it sees arises from a mind at peace within itself. No danger lurks     in anything it sees, for it is kind, and only kindness does it look upon. </p><p>The real world is the symbol that the dream of sin and guilt is over, and     God's Son no longer sleeps. His waking eyes perceive the sure reflection     of his Father's Love; the certain promise that he is redeemed. The real     world signifies the end of time, for its perception makes time purposeless. </p><p>The Holy Spirit has no need of time when it has served His purpose. Now     He waits but that one instant more for God to take His final step, and time     has disappeared, taking perception with it as it goes, and leaving but the     truth to be itself. That instant is our goal, for it contains the memory     of God. And as we look upon a world forgiven, it is He Who calls to us and     comes to take us home, reminding us of our Identity which our forgiveness     has restored to us.</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_291" id="lesson_291"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 291</h3></p><p align="center"><b>This     is a day of stillness and of peace. </b></p><p> Christ's vision looks through me today. His sight shows me all things forgiven     and at peace, and offers this same vision to the world. And I accept this     vision in its name, both for myself and for the world as well. What loveliness     we look upon today! What holiness we see surrounding us! And it is given     us to recognize it is a holiness in which we share; it is the Holiness of     God Himself. </p><p><i> This day my mind is quiet, to receive the Thoughts You offer me. And I accept     what comes from You, instead of from myself. I do not know the way to You.     But You are wholly certain. Father, guide Your Son along the quiet path     that leads to You. Let my forgiveness be complete, and let the memory of     You return to me.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
