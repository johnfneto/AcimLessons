And He guarantees that only joy can be     the final outcome found for everything. Yet it is up to us when this is     reached; how long we let an alien will appear to be opposing His. And while     we think this will is real, we will not find the end He has appointed as     the outcome of all problems we perceive, all trials we see, and every situation     that we meet. Yet is the ending certain. For God's Will is done in earth     and Heaven. We will seek and we will find according to His Will, which guarantees     that our will is done. </p><p><i> We thank You, Father, for Your guarantee of only happy outcomes in the end.     Help us not interfere, and so delay the happy endings You have promised     us for every problem that we can perceive; for every trial we think we still     must meet.</i></p>
