He     asks this gift that He may offer peace of mind to me, and take away all     terror and all pain. And as they are removed from me, the dreams that seemed     to settle on the world are gone. Redemption must be one. As I am saved,     the world is saved with me. For all of us must be redeemed together. Fear     appears in many different forms, but love is one. </p><p><i> My Father, Christ has asked a gift of me, and one I give that it be given     me. Help me to use the eyes of Christ today, and thus allow the Holy Spirit's     Love to bless all things which I may look upon, that His forgiving Love     may rest on me.</i></p>
