And everything I give I give myself. This is salvation's simple formula.     And I, who would be saved, would make it mine, to be the way I live within     a world that needs salvation, and that will be saved as I accept Atonement     for myself. </p><p><i> Father, how certain are Your ways; how sure their final outcome, and how     faithfully is every step in my salvation set already, and accomplished by     Your grace. Thanks be to You for Your eternal gifts, and thanks to You for     my Identity.</i></p>
