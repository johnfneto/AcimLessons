Yet God,     my Father, Who created it, acknowledges my holiness as His. Our Will, together,     understands it. And Our Will, together, knows that it is so. </p><p><i> Father, my holiness is not of me. It is not mine to be destroyed by sin.     It is not mine to suffer from attack. Illusions can obscure it, but can     not put out its radiance, nor dim its light. It stands forever perfect and     untouched. In it are all things healed, for they remain as You created them.     And I can know my holiness. For Holiness Itself created me, and I can know     my Source because it is Your Will that You be known.</i></p>
