Whatever you see becomes a proper subject for applying the     idea. Be sure that you do not question the suitability of anything for application     of the idea. These are not exercises in judgment. Anything is suitable if     you see it. Some of the things you see may have emotionally charged meaning     for you. Try to lay such feelings aside, and merely use these things exactly     as you would anything else. </p><p> The point of the exercises is to help you clear your mind of all past associations,     to see things exactly as they appear to you now, and to realize how little     you really understand about them. It is therefore essential that you keep     a perfectly open mind, unhampered by judgment, in selecting the things to     which the idea for the day is to be applied. For this purpose one thing     is like another; equally suitable and therefore equally useful.</p><hr />  <p><br />Each of the first three lessons should not be done more than twice a day each,     preferably morning and evening. Nor should they be attempted for more than     a minute or so, unless that entails a sense of hurry. A comfortable sense     of leisure is essential.<br /></p>			<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
