Yet this is also the idea that lets no false     perception keep us in its hold, nor represent more than a passing cloud     upon a sky eternally serene. And it is this serenity we seek, unclouded,     obvious and sure, today. </p><p><i> We seek Your holy world today. For we, Your loving Sons, have lost our          way a while. But we have listened to Your Voice, and learned exactly          what to do to be restored to Heaven and our true Identity. And we give          thanks today the world endures but for an instant. We would go beyond     that tiny instant to eternity. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
