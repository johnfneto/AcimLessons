Your holy world awaits us, as our sight     is finally restored and we can see. We thought we suffered. But we had forgot     the Son whom You created. Now we see that darkness is our own imagining,     and light is there for us to look upon. Christ's vision changes darkness     into light, for fear must disappear when love has come. Let me forgive Your     holy world today, that I may look upon its holiness and understand it but     reflects my own. </i></p><p> Our Love awaits us as we go to Him, and walks beside us showing us the way.     He fails in nothing. He the End we seek, and He the Means by which we go     to Him.</p>
