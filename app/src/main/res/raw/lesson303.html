Let all God's holy Thoughts surround     me, and be still with me while Heaven's Son is born. Let earthly sounds     be quiet, and the sights to which I am accustomed disappear. Let Christ     be welcomed where He is at home. And let Him hear the sounds He understands,     and see but sights that show His Father's Love. Let Him no longer be a stranger     here, for He is born again in me today. </p><p><i> Your Son is welcome, Father. He has come to save me from the evil self I     made. He is the Self that You have given me. He is but what I really am     in truth. He is the Son You love above all things. He is my Self as You     created me. It is not Christ that can be crucified. Safe in Your Arms let     me receive Your Son.</i></p>
