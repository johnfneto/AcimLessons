Nor can I behold     the holy sights Christ looks upon, unless it is His vision that I use. Perception     is a mirror, not a fact. And what I look on is my state of mind, reflected     outward. I would bless the world by looking on it through the eyes of Christ.     And I will look upon the certain signs that all my sins have been forgiven     me. </p><p><i> You lead me from the darkness to the light; from sin to holiness. Let me     forgive, and thus receive salvation for the world. It is Your gift, my Father,     given me to offer to Your holy Son, that he may find again the memory of     You, and of Your Son as You created him.</i></p>
