Comparisons     are still before this peace. And all the world departs in silence as this     peace envelops it, and gently carries it to truth, no more to be the home     of fear. For love has come, and healed the world by giving it Christ's peace. </p><p><i> Father, the peace of Christ is given us, because it is Your Will that we     be saved. Help us today but to accept Your gift, and judge it not. For it     has come to us to save us from our judgment on ourselves.</i></p>
