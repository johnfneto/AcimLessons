There is no other will for me to     have. Let me not try to make another will, for it is senseless and will     cause me pain. Your Will alone can bring me happiness, and only Yours exists.     If I would have what only You can give, I must accept Your Will for me,     and enter into peace where conflict is impossible. Your Son is one with     You in being and in will, and nothing contradicts the holy truth that I     remain as You created me. </i></p><p> And with this prayer we enter silently into a state where conflict cannot     come, because we join our holy will with God's, in recognition that they     are the same.</p>
