I, His Son, whose will is limitless as is His Own,     can will no change in this. For to deny my Father's Will is to deny my own.     To look within is but to find my will as God created it, and as it is. I     fear to look within because I think I made another will that is not true,     and made it real. Yet it has no effects. Within me is the Holiness of God.     Within me is the memory of Him. </p><p><i> The step I take today, my Father, is my sure release from idle dreams of     sin. Your altar stands serene and undefiled. It is the holy altar to my     Self, and there I find my true Identity.</i></p>
