<p>Christ's Second Coming gives the Son of God this gift: to hear the Voice     for God proclaim that what is false is false, and what is true has never     changed. And this the judgment is in which perception ends. At first you     see a world that has accepted this as true, projected from a now corrected     mind. And with this holy sight, perception gives a silent blessing and then     disappears, its goal accomplished and its mission done. </p><p>The final judgment on the world contains no condemnation. For it sees the     world as totally forgiven, without sin and wholly purposeless. Without a     cause, and now without a function in Christ's sight, it merely slips away     to nothingness. There it was born, and there it ends as well. And all the     figures in the dream in which the world began go with it. Bodies now are     useless, and will therefore fade away, because the Son of God is limitless. </p><p>You who believed that God's Last Judgment would condemn the world to hell     along with you, accept this holy truth: God's Judgment is the gift of the     Correction He bestowed on all your errors, freeing you from them, and all     effects they ever seemed to have. To fear God's saving grace is but to fear     complete release from suffering, return to peace, security and happiness,     and union with your own Identity. </p><p>God's Final Judgment is as merciful as every step in His appointed plan     to bless His Son, and call him to return to the eternal peace He shares     with him. Be not afraid of love. For it alone can heal all sorrow, wipe     away all tears, and gently waken from his dream of pain the Son whom God     acknowledges as His. Be not afraid of this. Salvation asks you give it welcome.     And the world awaits your glad acceptance, which will set it free. </p><p>This is God's Final Judgment: "You are still My holy Son, forever     innocent, forever loving and forever loved, as limitless as your Creator,     and completely changeless and forever pure. Therefore awaken and return     to Me. I am your Father and you are My Son."</p><hr /><p align="center"></p><p align="center"><a name="lesson_311" id="lesson_311"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 311</h3></p><p align="center"><b>I judge all things as I would have them     be. </b></p><p> Judgment was made to be a weapon used against the truth. It separates what     it is being used against, and sets it off as if it were a thing apart. And     then it makes of it what you would have it be. It judges what it cannot     understand, because it cannot see totality and therefore judges falsely.     Let us not use it today, but make a gift of it to Him Who has a different     use for it. He will relieve us of the agony of all the judgments we have     made against ourselves, and re-establish peace of mind by giving us God's     Judgment of His Son. </p><p><i> Father, we wait with open mind today, to hear Your Judgment of the Son You     love. We do not know him, and we cannot judge. And so we let Your Love decide     what he whom You created as Your Son must be.</i></p>
