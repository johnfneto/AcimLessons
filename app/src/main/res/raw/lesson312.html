Having judged, we therefore see what we would     look upon. For sight can merely serve to offer us what we would have. It     is impossible to overlook what we would see, and fail to see what we have     chosen to behold. How surely, therefore, must the real world come to greet     the holy sight of anyone who takes the Holy Spirit's purpose as his goal     for seeing. And he cannot fail to look upon what Christ would have him see,     and share Christ's Love for what he looks upon. </p><p><i> I have no purpose for today except to look upon a liberated world, set free     from all the judgments I have made. Father, this is Your Will for me today,     and therefore it must be my goal as well.</i></p>
