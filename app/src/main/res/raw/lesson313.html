And love will come wherever     it is asked. This vision is Your gift. The eyes of Christ look on a world     forgiven. In His sight are all its sins forgiven, for He sees no sin in     anything He looks upon. Now let His true perception come to me, that I may     waken from the dream of sin and look within upon my sinlessness, which You     have kept completely undefiled upon the altar to Your holy Son, the Self     with which I would identify. </i></p><p> Let us today behold each other in the sight of Christ. How beautiful we are!     How holy and how loving! Brother, come and join with me today. We save the     world when we have joined. For in our vision it becomes as holy as the light     in us.</p>
