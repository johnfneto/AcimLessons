I am     blessed with gifts throughout the day, in value far beyond all things of     which I can conceive. A brother smiles upon another, and my heart is gladdened.     Someone speaks a word of gratitude or mercy, and my mind receives this gift     and takes it as its own. And everyone who finds the way to God becomes my     savior, pointing out the way to me, and giving me his certainty that what     he learned is surely mine as well. </p><p><i> I thank You, Father, for the many gifts that come to me today and every day     from every Son of God. My brothers are unlimited in all their gifts to me.     Now may I offer them my thankfulness, that gratitude to them may lead me     on to my Creator and His memory.</i></p>
