What could conflict, when all the parts have but one purpose     and one aim? How could there be a single part that stands alone, or one     of more or less importance than the rest? I am the means by which God's     Son is saved, because salvation's purpose is to find the sinlessness that     God has placed in me. I was created as the thing I seek. I am the goal the     world is searching for. I am God's Son, His one eternal Love. I am salvation's     means and end as well. </p><p><i> Let me today, my Father, take the role You offer me in Your request that     I accept Atonement for myself. For thus does what is thereby reconciled     in me become as surely reconciled to You.</i></p>
