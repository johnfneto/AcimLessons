For arrogance opposes truth. But when there is no arrogance the     truth will come immediately, and fill up the space the ego left unoccupied     by lies. Only the ego can be limited, and therefore it must seek for aims     which are curtailed and limiting. The ego thinks that what one gains, totality     must lose. And yet it is the Will of God I learn that what one gains is     given unto all. </p><p><i> Father, Your Will is total. And the goal which stems from it shares its totality.     What aim but the salvation of the world could You have given me? And what     but this could be the Will my Self has shared with You?</i></p>
