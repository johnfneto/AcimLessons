 <p>Creation is the sum of all God's Thoughts, in number infinite, and everywhere     without all limit. Only love creates, and only like itself. There was no     time when all that it created was not there. Nor will there be a time when     anything that it created suffers any loss. Forever and forever are God's     Thoughts exactly as they were and as they are, unchanged through time and     after time is done. </p><p>God's Thoughts are given all the power that their own Creator has. For     He would add to love by its extension. Thus His Son shares in creation,     and must therefore share in power to create. What God has willed to be forever     One will still be One when time is over; and will not be changed throughout     the course of time, remaining as it was before the thought of time began. </p><p>Creation is the opposite of all illusions, for creation is the truth. Creation     is the holy Son of God, for in creation is His Will complete in every aspect,     making every part container of the whole. Its oneness is forever guaranteed     inviolate; forever held within His holy Will, beyond all possibility of     harm, of separation, imperfection and of any spot upon its sinlessness. </p><p>We are creation; we the Sons of God. We seem to be discrete, and unaware     of our eternal unity with Him. Yet back of all our doubts, past all our     fears, there still is certainty. For love remains with all its Thoughts,     its sureness being theirs. God's memory is in our holy minds, which know     their oneness and their unity with their Creator. Let our function be only     to let this memory return, only to let God's Will be done on earth, only     to be restored to sanity, and to be but as God created us. </p><p>Our Father calls to us. We hear His Voice, and we forgive creation in the     Name of its Creator, Holiness Itself, Whose Holiness His Own creation shares;     Whose Holiness is still a part of us.</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_321" id="lesson_321"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 321</h3></p><p align="center"><b>Father, my freedom is in You alone. </b></p><p><i> I did not understand what made me free, nor what my freedom is, nor where     to look to find it. Father, I have searched in vain until I heard Your Voice     directing me. Now I would guide myself no more. For I have neither made     nor understood the way to find my freedom. But I trust in You. You Who endowed     me with my freedom as Your holy Son will not be lost to me. Your Voice directs     me, and the way to You is opening and clear to me at last. Father, my freedom     is in You alone. Father, it is my will that I return. </i></p><p> Today we answer for the world, which will be freed along with us. How glad     are we to find our freedom through the certain way our Father has established.     And how sure is all the world's salvation, when we learn our freedom can     be found in God alone.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
