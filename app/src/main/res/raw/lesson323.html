Such is the "sacrifice" You     ask of me, and one I gladly make; the only "cost" of restoration     of Your memory to me, for the salvation of the world. </i></p><p> And as we pay the debt we owe to truth,&ndash;a debt that merely is the letting     go of self-deceptions and of images we worshipped falsely&ndash;truth returns     to us in wholeness and in joy. We are deceived no longer. Love has now returned     to our awareness. And we are at peace again, for fear has gone and only     love remains.</p>
