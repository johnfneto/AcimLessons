I am forever Your Effect, and You forever and forever are my Cause. As You     created me I have remained. Where You established me I still abide. And     all Your attributes abide in me, because it is Your Will to have a Son so     like his Cause that Cause and Its Effect are indistinguishable. Let me know     that I am an Effect of God, and so I have the power to create like You.     And as it is in Heaven, so on earth. Your plan I follow here, and at the     end I know that You will gather Your effects into the tranquil Heaven of     Your Love, where earth will vanish, and all separate thoughts unite in glory     as the Son of God. </i></p><p> Let us today behold earth disappear, at first transformed, and then, forgiven,     fade entirely into God's holy Will.</p>
