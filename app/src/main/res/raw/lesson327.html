For     God has promised He will hear my call, and answer me Himself. Let me but     learn from my experience that this is true, and faith in Him must surely     come to me. This is the faith that will endure, and take me farther and     still farther on the road that leads to Him. For thus I will be sure that     He has not abandoned me and loves me still, awaiting but my call to give     me all the help I need to come to Him. </p><p><i> Father, I thank You that Your promises will never fail in my experience,     if I but test them out. Let me attempt therefore to try them, and to judge     them not. Your Word is one with You. You give the means whereby conviction     comes, and surety of Your abiding Love is gained at last.</i></p>
