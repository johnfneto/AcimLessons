It seems that we will     gain autonomy but by our striving to be separate, and that our independence     from the rest of God's creation is the way in which salvation is obtained.     Yet all we find is sickness, suffering and loss and death. This is not what     our Father wills for us, nor is there any second to His Will. To join with     His is but to find our own. And since our will is His, it is to Him that     we must go to recognize our will. </p><p><i> There is no will but Yours. And I am glad that nothing I imagine contradicts     what You would have me be. It is Your Will that I be wholly safe, eternally     at peace. And happily I share that Will which You, my Father, gave as part     of me.</i></p>
