Yet what I am in truth     is but Your Will, extended and extending. This am I, and this will never     change. As You are One, so am I one with You. And this I chose in my creation,     where my will became forever one with Yours. That choice was made for all     eternity. It cannot change, and be in opposition to itself. Father, my will     is Yours. And I am safe, untroubled and serene, in endless joy, because     it is Your Will that it be so. </i></p><p> Today we will accept our union with each other and our Source. We have no     will apart from His, and all of us are one because His Will is shared by     all of us. Through it we recognize that we are one. Through it we find our     way at last to God.</p>
