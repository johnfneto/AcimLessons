  <p>The ego is idolatry; the sign of limited and separated self, born in a     body, doomed to suffer and to end its life in death. It is the "will" that     sees the Will of God as enemy, and takes a form in which it is denied. The     ego is the "proof" that strength is weak and love is fearful,     life is really death, and what opposes God alone is true. </p><p>The ego is insane. In fear it stands beyond the Everywhere, apart from     All, in separation from the Infinite. In its insanity it thinks it has become     a victor over God Himself. And in its terrible autonomy it "sees" the     Will of God has been destroyed. It dreams of punishment, and trembles at     the figures in its dreams; its enemies, who seek to murder it before it     can ensure its safety by attacking them. </p><p>The Son of God is egoless. What can he know of madness and the death of     God, when he abides in Him? What can he know of sorrow and of suffering,     when he lives in eternal joy? What can he know of fear and punishment, of     sin and guilt, of hatred and attack, when all there is surrounding him is     everlasting peace, forever conflict-free and undisturbed, in deepest silence     and tranquility? </p><p>To know reality is not to see the ego and its thoughts, its works, its     acts, its laws and its beliefs, its dreams, its hopes, its plans for its     salvation, and the cost belief in it entails. In suffering, the price for     faith in it is so immense that crucifixion of the Son of God is offered     daily at its darkened shrine, and blood must flow before the altar where     its sickly followers prepare to die. </p><p>Yet will one lily of forgiveness change the darkness into light; the altar     to illusions to the shrine of Life Itself. And peace will be restored forever     to the holy minds which God created as His Son, His dwelling place, His     joy, His love, completely His, completely one with Him.</p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_331" id="lesson_331"></a><h3 p align="center">Lesson 331</h3></p><p align="center"><b>There     is no conflict, for my will is Yours. </b></p><p><i> How foolish, Father, to believe Your Son could cause himself to suffer!          Could he make a plan for his damnation, and be left without a certain          way to his release? You love me, Father. You could never leave me desolate,          to die within a world of pain and cruelty. How could I think that Love          has left Itself? There is no will except the Will of Love. Fear is          a dream, and has no will that can conflict with Yours. Conflict is          sleep, and peace awakening. Death is illusion; life, eternal truth.          There is no opposition to Your Will. There is no conflict, for my will     is Yours. </i></p><p> Forgiveness shows us that God's Will is One, and that we share it. Let us     look upon the holy sights forgiveness shows today, that we may find the     peace of God. Amen.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
