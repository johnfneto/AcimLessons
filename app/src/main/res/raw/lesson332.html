Truth undoes its evil dreams by shining them away.     Truth never makes attack. It merely is. And by its presence is the mind     recalled from fantasies, awaking to the real. Forgiveness bids this presence     enter in, and take its rightful place within the mind. Without forgiveness     is the mind in chains, believing in its own futility. Yet with forgiveness     does the light shine through the dream of darkness, offering it hope, and     giving it the means to realize the freedom that is its inheritance. </p><p><i> We would not bind the world again today. Fear holds it prisoner. And yet     Your Love has given us the means to set it free. Father, we would release     it now. For as we offer freedom, it is given us. And we would not remain     as prisoners, while You are holding freedom out to us.</i></p>
