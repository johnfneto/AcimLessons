It cannot be evaded, set aside, denied, disguised,     seen somewhere else, called by another name, or hidden by deceit of any     kind, if it would be escaped. It must be seen exactly as it is, where it     is thought to be, in the reality which has been given it, and with the purpose     that the mind accorded it. For only then are its defenses lifted, and the     truth can shine upon it as it disappears. </p><p><i> Father, forgiveness is the light You chose to shine away all conflict and     all doubt, and light the way for our return to You. No light but this can     end our evil dream. No light but this can save the world. For this alone     will never fail in anything, being Your gift to Your beloved Son.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
