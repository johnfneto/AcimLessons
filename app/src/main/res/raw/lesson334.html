<font face="verdana" size="4">		    <h3 p align="center">Lesson 334</h3>    <p align="center"><b>Today I claim the gifts forgiveness gives. </b></p><p> I will not wait another day to find the treasures that my Father offers me.     Illusions are all vain, and dreams are gone even while they are woven out     of thoughts that rest on false perceptions. Let me not accept such meager     gifts again today. God's Voice is offering the peace of God to all who hear     and choose to follow Him. This is my choice today. And so I go to find the     treasures God has given me. </p><p><i> I seek but the eternal. For Your Son can be content with nothing less than     this. What, then, can be his solace but what You are offering to his bewildered     mind and frightened heart, to give him certainty and bring him peace? Today     I would behold my brother sinless. This Your Will for me, for so will I     behold my sinlessness.</i></p>
