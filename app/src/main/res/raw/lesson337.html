And only happiness can be my state, for only happiness is given me. What     must I do to know all this is mine? I must accept Atonement for myself,     and nothing more. God has already done all things that need be done. And     I must learn I need do nothing of myself, for I need but accept my Self,     my sinlessness, created for me, now already mine, to feel God's Love protecting     me from harm, to understand my Father loves His Son; to know I am the Son     my Father loves. </p><p><i> You Who created me in sinlessness are not mistaken about what I am. I was     mistaken when I thought I sinned, but I accept Atonement for myself. Father,     my dream is ended now. Amen.</i></p>
