For in this single     thought is everyone released at last from fear. Now has he learned that     no one frightens him, and nothing can endanger him. He has no enemies, and     he is safe from all external things. His thoughts can frighten him, but     since these thoughts belong to him alone, he has the power to change them     and exchange each fear thought for a happy thought of love. He crucified     himself. Yet God has planned that His beloved Son will be redeemed. </p><p><i> Your plan is sure, my Father,&mdash;only Yours. All other plans will          fail. And I will have thoughts that will frighten me, until I learn          that You have given me the only Thought that leads me to salvation.          Mine alone will fail, and lead me nowhere. But the Thought You gave          me promises to lead me home, because it holds Your promise to Your     Son.</i></p>
