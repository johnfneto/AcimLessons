But he can think that pain is pleasure. No one would     avoid his happiness. But he can think that joy is painful, threatening and     dangerous. Everyone will receive what he requests. But he can be confused     indeed about the things he wants; the state he would attain. What can he     then request that he would want when he receives it? He has asked for what     will frighten him, and bring him suffering. Let us resolve today to ask     for what we really want, and only this, that we may spend this day in fearlessness,     without confusing pain with joy, or fear with love. </p><p><i> Father, this is Your day. It is a day in which I would do nothing by myself,     but hear Your Voice in everything I do; requesting only what You offer me,     accepting only Thoughts You share with me.</i></p>
