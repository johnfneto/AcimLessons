<p>A miracle is a correction. It does not create, nor really change at all.     It merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is     false. It undoes error, but does not attempt to go beyond perception, nor     exceed the function of forgiveness. Thus it stays within time's limits.     Yet it paves the way for the return of timelessness and love's awakening,     for fear must slip away under the gentle remedy it brings. </p><p>A miracle contains the gift of grace, for it is given and received as one.     And thus it illustrates the law of truth the world does not obey, because     it fails entirely to understand its ways. A miracle inverts perception which     was upside down before, and thus it ends the strange distortions that were     manifest. Now is perception open to the truth. Now is forgiveness seen as     justified. </p><p>Forgiveness is the home of miracles. The eyes of Christ deliver them to     all they look upon in mercy and in love. Perception stands corrected in     His sight, and what was meant to curse has come to bless. Each lily of forgiveness     offers all the world the silent miracle of love. And each is laid before     the Word of God, upon the universal altar to Creator and creation in the     light of perfect purity and endless joy. </p><p>The miracle is taken first on faith, because to ask for it implies the     mind has been made ready to conceive of what it cannot see and does not     understand. Yet faith will bring its witnesses to show that what it rested     on is really there. And thus the miracle will justify your faith in it,     and show it rested on a world more real than what you saw before; a world     redeemed from what you thought was there. </p><p>Miracles fall like drops of healing rain from Heaven on a dry and dusty     world, where starved and thirsty creatures come to die. Now they have water.     Now the world is green. And everywhere the signs of life spring up, to show     that what is born can never die, for what has life has immortality.</p><p align="center"></p><hr /><p align="center"><h3 p align="center">Lesson 341</h3></p><p align="center"><b>I can attack but my own sinlessness, and it is only that which keeps me safe. </b></p><p><i> Father, Your Son is holy. I am he on whom You smile in love and tenderness     so dear and deep and still the universe smiles back on You, and shares Your     Holiness. How pure, how safe, how holy, then, are we, abiding in Your Smile,     with all Your Love bestowed upon us, living one with You, in brotherhood     and Fatherhood complete; in sinlessness so perfect that the Lord of Sinlessness     conceives us as His Son, a universe of Thought completing Him. </i></p><p> Let us not, then, attack our sinlessness, for it contains the Word of God     to us. And in its kind reflection we are saved.</p>
