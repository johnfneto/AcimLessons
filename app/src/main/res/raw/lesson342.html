It is     not real. And You have given me the means to prove its unreality to me.     The key is in my hand, and I have reached the door beyond which lies the     end of dreams. I stand before the gate of Heaven, wondering if I should     enter in and be at home. Let me not wait again today. Let me forgive all     things, and let creation be as You would have it be and as it is. Let me     remember that I am Your Son, and opening the door at last, forget illusions     in the blazing light of truth, as memory of You returns to me. </i></p><p> Brother, forgive me now. I come to you to take you home with me. And as we     go, the world goes with us on our way to God.</p>
