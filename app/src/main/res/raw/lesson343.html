The gift of everything can be but gain.     You only give. You never take away. And You created me to be like You, so     sacrifice becomes impossible for me as well as You. I, too, must give. And     so all things are given unto me forever and forever. As I was created I     remain. Your Son can make no sacrifice, for he must be complete, having     the function of completing You. I am complete because I am Your Son. I cannot     lose, for I can only give, and everything is mine eternally. </i></p><p> The mercy and the peace of God are free. Salvation has no cost. It is a gift     that must be freely given and received. And it is this that we would learn     today.</p>
