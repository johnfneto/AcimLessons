I have no cause for anything except the perfect peace     and joy I share with You. What need have I for anger or for fear? Surrounding     me is perfect safety. Can I be afraid, when Your eternal promise goes with     me? Surrounding me is perfect sinlessness. What can I fear, when You created     me in holiness as perfect as Your Own? </i></p><p> God's grace suffices us in everything that He would have us do. And only     that we choose to be our will as well as His.</p>
