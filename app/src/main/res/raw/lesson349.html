For thus do I obey the law of love, and give what I would find and     make my own. It will be given me, because I have chosen it as the gift I     want to give. Father, Your gifts are mine. Each one that I accept gives     me a miracle to give. And giving as I would receive, I learn Your healing     miracles belong to me. </i></p><p> Our Father knows our needs. He gives us grace to meet them all. And so we     trust in Him to send us miracles to bless the world, and heal our minds     as we return to Him.</p>
