			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 35</h3>    <p align="center"><b>My mind is part of God's. I am very holy. </b></p><p> Today's idea does not describe the way you see yourself now. It does, however,     describe what vision will show you. It is difficult for anyone who thinks     he is in this world to believe this of himself. Yet the reason he thinks     he is in this world is because he does not believe it. </p><p> You will believe that you are part of where you think you are. That is because     you surround yourself with the environment you want. And you want it to     protect the image of yourself that you have made. The image is part of this     environment. What you see while you believe you are in it is seen through     the eyes of the image. This is not vision. Images cannot see. </p><p> The idea for today presents a very different view of yourself. By establishing     your Source it establishes your Identity, and it describes you as you must     really be in truth. We will use a somewhat different kind of application     for today's idea because the emphasis for today is on the perceiver, rather     than on what he perceives. </p><p>For each of the three five-minute practice periods today, begin by repeating     today's idea to yourself, and then close your eyes and search your mind     for the various kinds of descriptive terms in which you see yourself. Include     all the ego-based attributes which you ascribe to yourself, positive or     negative, desirable or undesirable, grandiose or debased. All of them are     equally unreal, because you do not look upon yourself through the eyes of     holiness. </p><p> In the earlier part of the mind-searching period, you will probably emphasize     what you consider to be the more negative aspects of your perception of     yourself. Toward the latter part of the exercise period, however, more self-inflating     descriptive terms may well cross your mind. Try to recognize that the direction     of your fantasies about yourself does not matter. Illusions have no direction     in reality. They are merely not true. </p><p> A suitable unselected list for applying the idea for today might be as follows: </p>     <p><i>I see myself as imposed on. <br />          I see myself as depressed. <br />          I see myself as failing.          <br />          I see myself as endangered. <br />          I see myself as helpless. <br />          I see myself                    as victorious. <br />          I see myself as losing out. <br />          I see myself as          charitable. <br />          I see myself as virtuous. </i></p><p> You should not think of these terms in an abstract way. They will occur to     you as various situations, personalities and events in which you figure     cross your mind. Pick up any specific situation that occurs to you, identify     the descriptive term or terms you feel are applicable to your reactions     to that situation, and use them in applying today's idea. After you have     named each one, add: </p>     <p><i>But my mind is part of God's. I am very holy. </i></p><p> During the longer exercise periods, there will probably be intervals in which     nothing specific occurs to you. Do not strain to think up specific things     to fill the interval, but merely relax and repeat today's idea slowly until     something occurs to you. Although nothing that does occur should be omitted     from the exercises, nothing should be "dug out" with effort. Neither     force nor discrimination should be used. </p><p> As often as possible during the day, pick up a specific attribute or attributes     you are ascribing to yourself at the time and apply the idea for today to     them, adding the idea in the form stated above to each of them. If nothing     particular occurs to you, merely repeat the idea to yourself, with closed     eyes. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
