    <p>I am God's Son, complete and healed and whole, shining in the reflection     of His Love. In me is His creation sanctified and guaranteed eternal life.     In me is love perfected, fear impossible, and joy established without opposite.     I am the holy home of God Himself. I am the Heaven where His Love resides.     I am His holy Sinlessness Itself, for in my purity abides His Own. </p><p>Our use for words is almost over now. Yet in the final days of this one     year we gave to God together, you and I, we found a single purpose that     we shared. And thus you joined with me, so what I am are you as well. The     truth of what we are is not for words to speak of nor describe. Yet we can     realize our function here, and words can speak of this and teach it, too,     if we exemplify the words in us. </p><p>We are the bringers of salvation. We accept our part as saviors of the     world, which through our joint forgiveness is redeemed. And this, our gift,     is therefore given us. We look on everyone as brother, and perceive all     things as kindly and as good. We do not seek a function that is past the     gate of Heaven. Knowledge will return when we have done our part. We are     concerned only with giving welcome to the truth. </p><p>Ours are the eyes through which Christ's vision sees a world redeemed from     every thought of sin. Ours are the ears that hear the Voice for God proclaim     the world as sinless. Ours the minds that join together as we bless the     world. And from the oneness that we have attained we call to all our brothers,     asking them to share our peace and consummate our joy. </p><p>We are the holy messengers of God who speak for Him, and carrying His Word     to everyone whom He has sent to us, we learn that it is written on our hearts.     And thus our minds are changed about the aim for which we came, and which     we seek to serve. We bring glad tidings to the Son of God, who thought he     suffered. Now is he redeemed. And as he sees the gate of Heaven stand open     before him, he will enter in and disappear into the Heart of God.</p><p align="center"></p><hr /><h3 p align="center">Lesson 351</h3></p><p align="center"><b>My sinless brother is my guide to peace.     My sinful brother is my guide to     pain.     And which I choose to see I will behold. </b></p><p><i> Who is my brother but Your holy Son? And if I see him sinful I proclaim myself     a sinner, not a Son of God; alone and friendless in a fearful world. Yet     this perception is a choice I make, and can relinquish. I can also see my     brother sinless, as Your holy Son. And with this choice I see my sinlessness,     my everlasting Comforter and Friend beside me, and my way secure and clear.     Choose, then, for me, my Father, through Your Voice. For He alone gives     judgment in Your Name.</i></p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
