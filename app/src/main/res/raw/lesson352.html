But from the other comes the peace of God Himself. </b></p><p><i> Forgiveness looks on sinlessness alone, and judges not. Through this I come     to You. Judgment will bind my eyes and make me blind. Yet love, reflected     in forgiveness here, reminds me You have given me a way to find Your peace     again. I am redeemed when I elect to follow in this way. You have not left     me comfortless. I have within me both the memory of You, and One Who leads     me to it. Father, I would hear Your Voice and find Your peace today. For     I would love my own Identity, and find in It the memory of You.</i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
