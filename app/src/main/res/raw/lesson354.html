And in Him is His Creator, as He is in me. </b></p><p><i> My oneness with the Christ establishes me as Your Son, beyond the reach of     time, and wholly free of every law but Yours. I have no self except the     Christ in me. I have no purpose but His Own. And He is like His Father.     Thus must I be one with You as well as Him. For who is Christ except Your     Son as You created Him? And what am I except the Christ in me?</i></p>
