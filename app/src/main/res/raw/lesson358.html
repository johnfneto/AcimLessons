And of this I can be sure;     His answer is the one I really want. </b></p><p><i> You Who remember what I really am alone remember what I really want. You     speak for God, and so You speak for me. And what You give me comes from     God Himself. Your Voice, my Father, then is mine as well, and all I want     is what You offer me, in just the form You choose that it be mine. Let me     remember all I do not know, and let my voice be still, remembering. But     let me not forget Your Love and care, keeping Your promise to Your Son in     my awareness always. Let me not forget myself is nothing, but my Self is     all.</i></p>
