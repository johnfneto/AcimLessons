All prison doors are opened. And all sin is understood as merely     a mistake. </b></p><p><i> Father, today we will forgive Your world, and let creation be Your Own. We     have misunderstood all things. But we have not made sinners of the holy     Sons of God. What You created sinless so abides forever and forever. Such     are we. And we rejoice to learn that we have made mistakes which have no     real effects on us. Sin is impossible, and on this fact forgiveness rests     upon a certain base more solid than the shadow world we see. Help us forgive,     for we would be redeemed. Help us forgive, for we would be at peace.</i></p>
