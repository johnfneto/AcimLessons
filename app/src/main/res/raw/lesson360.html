Let all the world be blessed with peace through us. </b></p><p><i> Father, it is Your peace that I would give, receiving it of You. I am          Your Son, forever just as You created me, for the Great Rays remain          forever still and undisturbed within me. I would reach to them in silence          and in certainty, for nowhere else can certainty be found. Peace be          to me, and peace to all the world. In holiness were we created, and          in holiness do we remain. Your Son is like to You in perfect sinlessness.     And with this thought we gladly say "Amen."</i></p>
