 <p align="center"><b>Introduction </b></p><p>Our final lessons will be left as free of words as possible. We use them     but at the beginning of our practicing, and only to remind us that we seek     to go beyond them. Let us turn to Him Who leads the way and makes our footsteps     sure. To Him we leave these lessons, as to Him we give our lives henceforth.     For we would not return again to the belief in sin that made the world seem     ugly and unsafe, attacking and destroying, dangerous in all its ways, and     treacherous beyond the hope of trust and the escape from pain. </p><p>His is the only way to find the peace that God has given us. It is His     way that everyone must travel in the end, because it is this ending God     Himself appointed. In the dream of time it seems to be far off. And yet,     in truth, it is already here; already serving us as gracious guidance in     the way to go. Let us together follow in the way that truth points out to     us. And let us be the leaders of our many brothers who are seeking for the     way, but find it not. </p><p>And to this purpose let us dedicate our minds, directing all our thoughts     to serve the function of salvation. Unto us the aim is given to forgive     the world. It is the goal that God has given us. It is His ending to the     dream we seek, and not our own. For all that we forgive we will not fail     to recognize as part of God Himself. And thus His memory is given back,     completely and complete. </p><p>It is our function to remember Him on earth, as it is given us to be His     Own completion in reality. So let us not forget our goal is shared, for     it is that remembrance which contains the memory of God, and points the     way to Him and to the Heaven of His peace. And shall we not forgive our     brother, who can offer this to us? He is the way, the truth and life that     shows the way to us. In him resides salvation, offered us through our forgiveness,     given unto him. </p><p>We will not end this year without the gift our Father promised to His holy     Son. We are forgiven now. And we are saved from all the wrath we thought     belonged to God, and found it was a dream. We are restored to sanity, in     which we understand that anger is insane, attack is mad, and vengeance merely     foolish fantasy. We have been saved from wrath because we learned we were     mistaken. Nothing more than that. And is a father angry at his son because     he failed to understand the truth? </p><p>We come in honesty to God and say we did not understand, and ask Him to     help us to learn His lessons, through the Voice of His Own Teacher. Would     He hurt His Son? Or would He rush to answer him, and say, "This is     My Son, and all I have is his"? Be certain He will answer thus, for     these are His Own words to you. And more than that can no one ever have,     for in these words is all there is, and all that there will be throughout     all time and in eternity.</p><p align="center"></p><hr /><h3 p align="center">Lesson 361</h3></p><p align="center"><b>This holy instant would I give to You.   Be You in charge. For I would follow You, certain that Your direction gives me peace. </b></p><p> And if I need a word to help me, He will give it to me. If I need a thought,     that will He also give. And if I need but stillness and a tranquil, open     mind, these are the gifts I will receive of Him. He is in charge by my request.     And He will hear and answer me, because He speaks for God my Father and     His holy Son. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
