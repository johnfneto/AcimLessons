For I would follow     You, certain that Your direction gives me peace. </b></p><p> And if I need a word to help me, He will give it to me. If I need a thought,     that will He also give. And if I need but stillness and a tranquil, open     mind, these are the gifts I will receive of Him. He is in charge by my request.     And He will hear and answer me, because He speaks for God my Father and     His holy Son. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
