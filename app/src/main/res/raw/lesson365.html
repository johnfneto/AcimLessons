For I would follow     You,      certain that Your direction gives me peace. </b></p><p> And if I need a word to help me, He will give it to me. If I need a thought,     that will He also give. And if I need but stillness and a tranquil, open     mind, these are the gifts I will receive of Him. He is in charge by my request.     And He will hear and answer me, because He speaks for God my Father and     His holy Son. </p><hr /><p align="center"><b>EPILOGUE</b></p><p>This course is a beginning, not an end. Your Friend goes with you. You     are not alone. No one who calls on Him can call in vain. Whatever troubles     you, be certain that He has the answer, and will gladly give it to you,     if you simply turn to Him and ask it of Him. He will not withhold all answers     that you need for anything that seems to trouble you. He knows the way to     solve all problems, and resolve all doubts. His certainty is yours. You     need but ask it of Him, and it will be given you. </p><p>You are as certain of arriving home as is the pathway of the sun laid down     before it rises, after it has set, and in the half-lit hours in between.     Indeed, your pathway is more certain still. For it can not be possible to     change the course of those whom God has called to Him. Therefore obey your     will, and follow Him Whom you accepted as your voice, to speak of what you     really want and really need. His is the Voice for God and also yours. And     thus He speaks of freedom and of truth. </p><p>No more specific lessons are assigned, for there is no more need of them.     Henceforth, hear but the Voice for God and for your Self when you retire     from the world, to seek reality instead. He will direct your efforts, telling     you exactly what to do, how to direct your mind, and when to come to Him     in silence, asking for His sure direction and His certain Word. His is the     Word that God has given you. His is the Word you chose to be your own. </p><p>And now I place you in His hands, to be His faithful follower, with Him     as Guide through every difficulty and all pain that you may think is real.     Nor will He give you pleasures that will pass away, for He gives only the     eternal and the good. Let Him prepare you further. He has earned your trust     by speaking daily to you of your Father and your brother and your Self.     He will continue. Now you walk with Him, as certain as is He of where you     go; as sure as He of how you should proceed; as confident as He is of the     goal, and of your safe arrival in the end. </p><p>The end is certain, and the means as well. To this we say "Amen." You     will be told exactly what God wills for you each time there is a choice     to make. And He will speak for God and for your Self, thus making sure that     hell will claim you not, and that each choice you make brings Heaven nearer     to your reach. And so we walk with Him from this time on, and turn to Him     for guidance and for peace and sure direction. Joy attends our way. For     we go homeward to an open door which God has held unclosed to welcome us. </p><p>We trust our ways to Him and say "Amen." In peace we will continue     in His way, and trust all things to Him. In confidence we wait His answers,     as we ask His Will in everything we do. He loves God's Son as we would love     him. And He teaches us how to behold him through His eyes, and love him     as He does. You do not walk alone. God's angels hover near and all about.     His Love surrounds you, and of this be sure; that I will never leave you     comfortless.</p>	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
