			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 42</h3>    <p align="center"><b>God is my strength. Vision is His gift. </b></p><p> The idea for today combines two very powerful thoughts, both of major importance.     It also sets forth a cause and effect relationship that explains why you     cannot fail in your efforts to achieve the goal of the course. You will     see because it is the Will of God. It is His strength, not your own, that     gives you power. And it is His gift, rather than your own, that offers vision     to you. </p><p> God is indeed your strength, and what He gives is truly given. This means     that you can receive it any time and anywhere, wherever you are, and in     whatever circumstance you find yourself. Your passage through time and space     is not at random. You cannot but be in the right place at the right time.     Such is the strength of God. Such are His gifts. </p><p> We will have two three-to-five-minute practice periods today, one as soon     as possible after you wake, and another as close as possible to the time     you go to sleep. It is better, however, to wait until you can sit quietly     by yourself, at a time when you feel ready, than it is to be concerned with     the time as such. </p><p> Begin these practice periods by repeating the idea for today slowly, with     your eyes open, looking about you. Then close your eyes and repeat the idea     again, even slower than before. After this, try to think of nothing except     thoughts that occur to you in relation to the idea for the day. You might     think, for example: </p><p align="center"><i>Vision must be possible. God gives truly, </i></p><p align="center">or: </p><p align="center"><i>God's gifts to me must be     mine, because He gave them to me. </i></p><p> Any thought that is clearly related to the idea for today is suitable. You     may, in fact, be astonished at the amount of course-related understanding     some of your thoughts contain. Let them come without censoring unless you     find your mind is merely wandering, and you have let obviously irrelevant     thoughts intrude. You may also reach a point where no thoughts at all seem     to come to mind. If such interferences occur, open your eyes and repeat     the thought once more while looking slowly about; close your eyes, repeat     the idea once more, and then continue to look for related thoughts in your     mind. </p><p> Remember, however, that active searching for relevant thoughts is not appropriate     for today's exercises. Try merely to step back and let the thoughts come.     If you find this difficult, it is better to spend the practice period alternating     between slow repetitions of the idea with eyes open, then with eyes closed,     than it is to strain to find suitable thoughts. </p><p> There is no limit on the number of short practice periods that would be beneficial     today. The idea for the day is a beginning step in bringing thoughts together,     and teaching you that you are studying a unified thought system in which     nothing is lacking that is needed, and nothing is included that is contradictory     or irrelevant. </p><p> The more often you repeat the idea during the day, the more often you will     be reminding yourself that the goal of the course is important to you, and     that you have not forgotten it. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
