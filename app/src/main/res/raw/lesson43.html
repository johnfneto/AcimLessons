			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 43</h3>    <p align="center"><b>God is my Source. I cannot see apart from     Him. </b></p><p> Perception is not an attribute of God. His is the realm of knowledge. Yet     He has created the Holy Spirit as the Mediator between perception and knowledge.     Without this link with God, perception would have replaced knowledge forever     in your mind. With this link with God, perception will become so changed     and purified that it will lead to knowledge. That is its function as the     Holy Spirit sees it. Therefore, that is its function in truth. </p><p> In God you cannot see. Perception has no function in God, and does not exist.     Yet in salvation, which is the undoing of what never was, perception has     a mighty purpose. Made by the Son of God for an unholy purpose, it must     become the means for the restoration of his holiness to his awareness. Perception     has no meaning. Yet does the Holy Spirit give it a meaning very close to     God's. Healed perception becomes the means by which the Son of God forgives     his brother, and thus forgives himself. </p><p> You cannot see apart from God because you cannot be apart from God. Whatever     you do you do in Him, because whatever you think, you think with His Mind.     If vision is real, and it is real to the extent to which it shares the Holy     Spirit's purpose, then you cannot see apart from God. </p><p> Three five-minute practice periods are required today, one as early and one     as late as possible in the day. The third may be undertaken at the most     convenient and suitable time that circumstances and readiness permit. At     the beginning of these practice periods, repeat the idea for today to yourself     with eyes open. Then glance around you for a short time, applying the idea     specifically to what you see. Four or five subjects for this phase of the     practice period are sufficient. You might say, for example: </p>     <p><i>God is my Source. I cannot see this desk apart from Him.<br />          God is my               Source. I cannot see that picture apart from Him. </i></p><p> Although this part of the exercise period should be relatively short, be     sure that you select the subjects for this phase of practice indiscriminately,     without self-directed inclusion or exclusion. For the second and longer     phase, close your eyes, repeat today's idea again, and then let whatever     relevant thoughts occur to you add to the idea in your own personal way.     Thoughts such as: </p>     <p><i>I see through the eyes of forgiveness. <br />          I see the world as blessed. <br />          The world          can show me myself. <br />          I see my own thoughts, which are like God's. </i></p><p>Any thought related more or less directly to today's idea is suitable. The     thoughts need not bear any obvious relationship to the idea, but they should     not be in opposition to it. </p><p> If you find your mind wandering; if you begin to be aware of thoughts which     are clearly out of accord with today's idea, or if you seem to be unable     to think of anything, open your eyes, repeat the first phase of the exercise     period, and then attempt the second phase again. Do not allow any protracted     period to occur in which you become preoccupied with irrelevant thoughts.     Return to the first phase of the exercises as often as necessary to prevent     this. </p><p> In applying today's idea in the shorter practice periods, the form may vary     according to the circumstances and situations in which you find yourself     during the day. When you are with someone else, for example, try to remember     to tell him silently: </p>     <p><i>God is my Source. I cannot see you apart from Him. </i></p><p>This form is equally applicable to strangers as it is to those you think are     closer to you. In fact, try not to make distinctions of this kind at all. </p><p> Today's idea should also be applied throughout the day to various situations     and events that may occur, particularly to those which seem to distress     you in any way. For this purpose, apply the idea in this form: </p>     <p><i>God is my Source. I cannot see this apart from Him. </i></p><p> If no particular subject presents itself to your awareness at the time, merely     repeat the idea in its original form.  Try today not to allow any long     periods of time to slip by without remembering today's idea, and thus remembering     your function. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
