			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 45</h3>    <p align="center"><b>God is the Mind with which I think. </b></p><p> Today's idea holds the key to what your real thoughts are. They are nothing     that you think you think, just as nothing that you think you see is related     to vision in any way. There is no relationship between what is real and     what you think is real. Nothing that you think are your real thoughts resemble     your real thoughts in any respect. Nothing that you think you see bears     any resemblance to what vision will show you. </p><p> You think with the Mind of God. Therefore you share your thoughts with Him,     as He shares His with you. They are the same thoughts, because they are     thought by the same Mind. To share is to make alike, or to make one. Nor     do the thoughts you think with the Mind of God leave your mind, because     thoughts do not leave their source. Therefore, your thoughts are in the     Mind of God, as you are. They are in your mind as well, where He is. As     you are part of His Mind, so are your thoughts part of His Mind. </p><p> Where, then, are your real thoughts? Today we will attempt to reach them.     We will have to look for them in your mind, because that is where they are.     They must still be there, because they cannot have left their source. What     is thought by the Mind of God is eternal, being part of creation. </p><p> Our three five-minute practice periods for today will take the same general     form that we used in applying yesterday's idea. We will attempt to leave     the unreal and seek for the real. We will deny the world in favor of truth.     We will not let the thoughts of the world hold us back. We will not let     the beliefs of the world tell us that what God would have us do is impossible.     Instead, we will try to recognize that only what God would have us do is     possible. </p><p> We will also try to understand that only what God would have us do is what     we want to do. And we will also try to remember that we cannot fail in doing     what He would have us do. There is every reason to feel confident that we     will succeed today. It is the Will of God. </p><p> Begin the exercises for today by repeating the idea to yourself, closing     your eyes as you do so. Then spend a fairly short period in thinking a few     relevant thoughts of your own, keeping the idea in mind. After you have     added some four or five thoughts of your own to the idea, repeat it again     and tell yourself gently: </p>     <p><i>My real thoughts are in my mind. I would like to find them. </i></p><p> Then try to go past all the unreal thoughts that cover the truth in your     mind, and reach to the eternal. </p><p> Under all the senseless thoughts and mad ideas with which you have cluttered     up your mind are the thoughts that you thought with God in the beginning.     They are there in your mind now, completely unchanged. They will always     be in your mind, exactly as they always were. Everything you have thought     since then will change, but the Foundation on which it rests is wholly changeless. </p><p> It is this Foundation toward which the exercises for today are directed.     Here is your mind joined with the Mind of God. Here are your thoughts one     with His. For this kind of practice only one thing is necessary; approach     it as you would an altar dedicated in Heaven to God the Father and to God     the Son. For such is the place you are trying to reach. You will probably     be unable as yet to realize how high you are trying to go. Yet even with     the little understanding you have already gained, you should be able to     remind yourself that this is no idle game, but an exercise in holiness and     an attempt to reach the Kingdom of Heaven . </p><p> In the shorter exercise periods for today, try to remember how important     it is to you to understand the holiness of the mind that thinks with God.     Take a minute or two, as you repeat the idea throughout the day, to appreciate     your mind's holiness. Stand aside, however briefly, from all thoughts that     are unworthy of Him Whose host you are. And thank Him for the Thoughts He     is thinking with you. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
