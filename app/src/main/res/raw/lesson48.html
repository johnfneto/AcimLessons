			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 48</h3>    <p align="center"><b>There is nothing to fear. </b></p><p> The idea for today simply states a fact. It is not a fact to those who believe     in illusions, but illusions are not facts. In truth there is nothing to     fear. It is very easy to recognize this. But it is very difficult to recognize     it for those who want illusions to be true. </p><p> Today's practice periods will be very short, very simple and very frequent.     Merely repeat the idea as often as possible. You can use it with your eyes     open at any time and in any situation. It is strongly recommended, however,     that you take a minute or so whenever possible to close your eyes and repeat     the idea slowly to yourself several times. It is particularly important     that you use the idea immediately, should anything disturb your peace of     mind. </p><p> The presence of fear is a sure sign that you are trusting in your own strength.     The awareness that there is nothing to fear shows that somewhere in your     mind, though not necessarily in a place you recognize as yet, you have remembered     God, and let His strength take the place of your weakness. The instant you     are willing to do this there is indeed nothing to fear. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
