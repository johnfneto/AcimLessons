Apply it specifically to whatever     you believe is the cause of your upset, using the description of the feeling     in whatever term seems accurate to you. The upset may seem to be fear, worry,     depression, anxiety, anger, hatred, jealousy or any number of forms, all     of which will be perceived as different. This is not true. However, until     you learn that form does not matter, each form becomes a proper subject     for the exercises for the day. Applying the same idea to each of them separately     is the first step in ultimately recognizing they are all the same. </p><p> When using the idea for today for a specific perceived cause of an upset     in any form, use both the name of the form in which you see the upset, and     the cause which you ascribe to it. For example: </p>     <p><i>I am not angry at ___ for the reason I think.<br />     </i><i>I am not afraid of ___ for the     reason I think. </i></p><p> But again, this should not be substituted for practice periods in which you     first search your mind for "sources" of upset in which you believe,     and forms of upset which you think result. </p><p> In these exercises, more than in the preceding ones, you may find it hard     to be indiscriminate, and to avoid giving greater weight to some subjects     than to others. It might help to precede the exercises with the statement: </p>     <p><i>There are no small upsets. <br />          They are all equally disturbing to my peace of          mind. </i></p><p> Then examine your mind for whatever is distressing you, regardless of how     much or how little you think it is doing so. </p><p> You may also find yourself less willing to apply today's idea to some perceived     sources of upset than to others. If this occurs, think first of this: </p>     <p><i>I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go. <br />          For the purposes of          these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same. </i></p><p> Then search your mind for no more than a minute or so, and try to identify     a number of different forms of upset that are disturbing you, regardless     of the relative importance you may give them. Apply the idea for today to     each of them, using the name of both the source of the upset as you perceive     it, and of the feeling as you experience it. Further examples are: </p>     <p><i>I am not worried about ___ for the reason I think. <br />          I am not depressed about          ___ for the reason I think. </i></p><p>Three or four times during the day is enough. <br /></p ><br />
