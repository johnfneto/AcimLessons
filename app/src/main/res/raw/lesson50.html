			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 50</h3>    <p align="center"><b>I am sustained by the Love of God. </b></p><p> Here is the answer to every problem that will confront you, today and tomorrow     and throughout time. In this world, you believe you are sustained by everything     but God. Your faith is placed in the most trivial and insane symbols; pills,     money, "protective" clothing, influence, prestige, being liked,     knowing the "right" people, and an endless list of forms of nothingness     that you endow with magical powers. </p><p> All these things are your replacements for the Love of God. All these things     are cherished to ensure a body identification. They are songs of praise     to the ego. Do not put your faith in the worthless. It will not sustain     you. </p><p> Only the Love of God will protect you in all circumstances. It will lift     you out of every trial, and raise you high above all the perceived dangers     of this world into a climate of perfect peace and safety. It will transport     you into a state of mind that nothing can threaten, nothing can disturb,     and where nothing can intrude upon the eternal calm of the Son of God. </p><p> Put not your faith in illusions. They will fail you. Put all your faith in     the Love of God within you; eternal, changeless and forever unfailing. This     is the answer to whatever confronts you today. Through the Love of God within     you, you can resolve all seeming difficulties without effort and in sure     confidence. Tell yourself this often today. It is a declaration of release     from the belief in idols. It is your acknowledgment of the truth about yourself. </p><p> For ten minutes, twice today, morning and evening, let the idea for today     sink deep into your consciousness. Repeat it, think about it, let related     thoughts come to help you recognize its truth, and allow peace to flow over     you like a blanket of protection and surety. Let no idle and foolish thoughts     enter to disturb the holy mind of the Son of God. Such is the Kingdom of     Heaven . Such is the resting place where your Father has placed you forever. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
