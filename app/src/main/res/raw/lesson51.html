			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 51</h3>    <p align="center"><b>Review I <br />Introduction</b></p><p>Beginning with today we will have a series of review periods.     Each of them will cover five of the ideas already presented, starting with     the first and ending with the fiftieth. There will be a few short comments     after each of the ideas, which you should consider in your review. In the     practice periods, the exercises should be done as follows:</p><p>Begin the day by reading the five ideas, with the comments     included. Thereafter, it is not necessary to follow any particular order     in considering them, though each one should be practiced at least once.     Devote two minutes or more to each practice period, thinking about the idea     and the related comments after reading them over. Do this as often as possible     during the day. If any one of the five ideas appeals to you more than the     others, concentrate on that one. At the end of the day, however, be sure     to review all of them once more.</p><p>It is not necessary to cover the comments that follow     each idea either literally or thoroughly in the practice periods. Try, rather,     to emphasize the central point, and think about it as part of your review     of the idea to which it relates. After you have read the idea and the related     comments, the exercises should be done with your eyes closed and when you     are alone in a quiet place, if possible.</p><p>This is emphasized for practice periods at your stage     of learning. It will be necessary, however, that you learn to require no     special settings in which to apply what you have learned. You will need     your learning most in situations that appear to be upsetting, rather than     in those that already seem to be calm and quiet. The purpose of your learning     is to enable you to bring the quiet with you, and to heal distress and turmoil.     This is not done by avoiding them and seeking a haven of isolation for yourself.</p><p>You will yet learn that peace is part of you, and requires     only that you be there to embrace any situation in which you are. And finally     you will learn that there is no limit to where you are, so that your peace     is everywhere, as you are.</p><p>You will note that, for review purposes, some of the ideas     are not given in quite their original form. Use them as they are given here.     It is not necessary to return to the original statements, nor to apply the     ideas as was suggested then. We are now emphasizing the relationships among     the first fifty of the ideas we have covered, and the cohesiveness of the     thought system to which they are leading you.</p><p align="center"></p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_51" id="lesson_51"></a><b>Lesson 51</b></p><p align="center">The     review for today covers the following ideas: </p><p><b>(1) Nothing I see means anything. </b></p><p>The reason this is so is that I see nothing,     and nothing has no meaning. It is necessary that I recognize this, that     I may learn to see. What I think I see now is taking the place of vision.     I must let it go by realizing it has no meaning, so that vision may take     its place. </p><p><b>(2) I have given what I see all the meaning it has for me.</b></p><p>I have judged everything I look upon, and it is this and only this I see.     This is not vision. It is merely an illusion of reality, because my judgments     have been made quite apart from reality. I am willing to recognize the lack     of validity in my judgments, because I want to see. My judgments have hurt     me, and I do not want to see according to them. </p><p><b>(3) I do not understand anything I see. </b></p><p>How could I understand what I see when     I have judged it amiss? What I see is the projection of my own errors of     thought. I do not understand what I see because it is not understandable.     There is no sense in trying to understand it. But there is every reason     to let it go, and make room for what can be seen and understood and loved.     I can exchange what I see now for this merely by being willing to do so.     Is not this a better choice than the one I made before? </p><p><b>(4) These thoughts do not mean anything.</b></p><p>The thoughts of which I am aware do not mean anything because I am trying     to think without God. What I call "my" thoughts are not my real     thoughts. My real thoughts are the thoughts I think with God. I am not aware     of them because I have made my thoughts to take their place. I am willing     to recognize that my thoughts do not mean anything, and to let them go.     I choose to have them be replaced by what they were intended to replace.     My thoughts are meaningless, but all creation lies in the thoughts I think     with God. </p><p><b>(5) I am never upset for the reason I think. </b></p><p>I am never upset for the reason     I think because I am constantly trying to justify my thoughts. I am constantly     trying to make them true. I make all things my enemies, so that my anger     is justified and my attacks are warranted. I have not realized how much     I have misused everything I see by assigning this role to it. I have done     this to defend a thought system that has hurt me, and that I no longer want.     I am willing to let it go. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
