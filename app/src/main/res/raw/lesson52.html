			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 52</h3>    <p align="center">Today's review covers these ideas: </p><p><b>(6) I am upset because I see what is not there. </b></p><p>Reality is never frightening.     It is impossible that it could upset me. Reality brings only perfect peace.     When I am upset, it is always because I have replaced reality with illusions     I made up. The illusions are upsetting because I have given them reality,     and thus regard reality as an illusion. Nothing in God's creation is affected     in any way by this confusion of mine. I am always upset by nothing. </p><p><b>(7) I see only the past. </b></p><p>As I look about, I condemn the world I look upon.     I call this seeing. I hold the past against everyone and everything, making     them my enemies. When I have forgiven myself and remembered Who I am, I     will bless everyone and everything I see. There will be no past, and therefore     no enemies. And I will look with love on all that I failed to see before. </p><p><b> (8) My mind is preoccupied with past thoughts. </b></p><p>I see only my own thoughts,     and my mind is preoccupied with the past. What, then, can I see as it is?     Let me remember that I look on the past to prevent the present from dawning     on my mind. Let me understand that I am trying to use time against God.     Let me learn to give the past away, realizing that in so doing I am giving     up nothing. </p><p><b>(9) I see nothing as it is now. </b></p><p>If I see nothing as it is now, it can truly     be said that I see nothing. I can see only what is now. The choice is not     whether to see the past or the present; the choice is merely whether to     see or not. What I have chosen to see has cost me vision. Now I would choose     again, that I may see. </p><p><b>(10) My thoughts do not mean anything. </b></p><p>I have no private thoughts. Yet it is     only private thoughts of which I am aware. What can these thoughts mean?     They do not exist, and so they mean nothing. Yet my mind is part of creation     and part of its Creator. Would I not rather join the thinking of the universe     than to obscure all that is really mine with my pitiful and meaningless "private" thoughts? </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
