			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 53</h3>    <p align="center">Today we will review the following: </p><p><b>(11) My meaningless thoughts are showing me a meaningless world. </b></p><p>Since the thoughts     of which I am aware do not mean anything, the world that pictures them can     have no meaning. What is producing this world is insane, and so is what     it produces. Reality is not insane, and I have real thoughts as well as     insane ones. I can therefore see a real world, if I look to my real thoughts     as my guide for seeing. </p><p><b>(12) I am upset because I see a meaningless world. </b></p><p>Insane thoughts are upsetting.     They produce a world in which there is no order anywhere. Only chaos rules     a world that represents chaotic thinking, and chaos has no laws. I cannot     live in peace in such a world. I am grateful that this world is not real,     and that I need not see it at all unless I choose to value it. And I do     not choose to value what is totally insane and has no meaning. </p><p><b>(13) A meaningless world engenders fear. </b></p><p>The totally insane engenders fear because     it is completely undependable, and offers no grounds for trust. Nothing     in madness is dependable. It holds out no safety and no hope. But such a     world is not real. I have given it the illusion of reality, and have suffered     from my belief in it. Now I choose to withdraw this belief, and place my     trust in reality. In choosing this, I will escape all the effects of the     world of fear, because I am acknowledging that it does not exist. </p><p><b>(14) God did not create a meaningless world. </b></p><p>How can a meaningless world exist     if God did not create it? He is the Source of all meaning, and everything     that is real is in His Mind. It is in my mind too, because He created it     with me. Why should I continue to suffer from the effects of my own insane     thoughts, when the perfection of creation is my home? Let me remember the     power of my decision, and recognize where I really abide. </p><p><b>(15) My thoughts are images that I have made. </b></p><p>Whatever I see reflects my thoughts.     It is my thoughts that tell me where I am and what I am. The fact that I     see a world in which there is suffering and loss and death shows me that     I am seeing only the representation of my insane thoughts, and am not allowing     my real thoughts to cast their beneficent light on what I see. Yet God's     way is sure. The images I have made cannot prevail against Him because it     is not my will that they do so. My will is His, and I will place no other     gods before Him. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
