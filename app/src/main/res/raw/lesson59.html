			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 59</h3>    <p align="center">The following ideas are for review     today: </p><p><b>(41) God goes with me wherever I go. </b></p><p>How can I be alone when God always goes     with me? How can I be doubtful and unsure of myself when perfect certainty     abides in Him? How can I be disturbed by anything when He rests in me in     absolute peace? How can I suffer when love and joy surround me through Him?     Let me not cherish illusions about myself. I am perfect because God goes     with me wherever I go. </p><p><b>(42) God is my strength. Vision is His gift. </b></p><p>Let me not look to my own eyes     to see today. Let me be willing to exchange my pitiful illusion of seeing     for the vision that is given by God. Christ's vision is His gift, and He     has given it to me. Let me call upon this gift today, so that this day may     help me to understand eternity. </p><p><b>(43) God is my Source. I cannot see apart from Him. </b></p><p>I can see what God wants     me to see. I cannot see anything else. Beyond His Will lie only illusions.     It is these I choose when I think I can see apart from Him. It is these     I choose when I try to see through the body's eyes. Yet the vision of Christ     has been given me to replace them. It is through this vision that I choose     to see. </p><p><b>(44) God is the light in which I see.</b></p><p>I cannot see in darkness. God is the only light. Therefore, if I am to see,     it must be through Him. I have tried to define what seeing is, and I have     been wrong. Now it is given me to understand that God is the light in which     I see. Let me welcome vision and the happy world it will show me. </p><p><b>(45) God is the Mind with which I think. </b></p><p>I have no thoughts I do not share with     God. I have no thoughts apart from Him, because I have no mind apart from     His. As part of His Mind, my thoughts are His and His Thoughts are mine.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
