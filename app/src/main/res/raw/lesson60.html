			<h3 p align="center">Lesson 60</h3>    <p align="center">These ideas are for today's review: </p><p><b>(46) God is the Love in which I forgive. </b></p><p>God does not forgive because He has     never condemned. The blameless cannot blame, and those who have accepted     their innocence see nothing to forgive. Yet forgiveness is the means by     which I will recognize my innocence. It is the reflection of God's Love     on earth. It will bring me near enough to Heaven that the Love of God can     reach down to me and raise me up to Him. </p><p><b>(47) God is the strength in which I trust. </b></p><p>It is not my own strength through     which I forgive. It is through the strength of God in me, which I am remembering     as I forgive. As I begin to see, I recognize His reflection on earth. I     forgive all things because I feel the stirring of His strength in me. And     I begin to remember the Love I chose to forget, but which has not forgotten     me. </p><p><b>(48) There is nothing to fear. </b></p><p>How safe the world will look to me when I can     see it! It will not look anything like what I imagine I see now. Everyone     and everything I see will lean toward me to bless me. I will recognize in     everyone my dearest Friend. What could there be to fear in a world that     I have forgiven, and that has forgiven me? </p><p><b>(49) God's Voice speaks to me all through the day. </b></p><p>There is not a moment in     which God's Voice ceases to call on my forgiveness to save me. There is     not a moment in which His Voice fails to direct my thoughts, guide my actions     and lead my feet. I am walking steadily on toward truth. There is nowhere     else I can go, because God's Voice is the only Voice and the only Guide     that has been given to His Son. </p><p><b>(50) I am sustained by the Love of God. </b></p><p>As I listen to God's Voice, I am sustained     by His Love. As I open my eyes, His Love lights up the world for me to see.     As I forgive, His Love reminds me that His Son is sinless. And as I look     upon the world with the vision He has given me, I remember that I am His     Son. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
