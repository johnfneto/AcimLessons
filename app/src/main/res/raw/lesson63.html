How blessed     are you who can learn to recognize the means for letting this be done through     you! What purpose could you have that would bring you greater happiness? </p><p> You are indeed the light of the world with such a function. The Son of God     looks to you for his redemption. It is yours to give him, for it belongs     to you. Accept no trivial purpose or meaningless desire in its place, or     you will forget your function and leave the Son of God in hell. This is     no idle request that is being asked of you. You are being asked to accept     salvation that it may be yours to give. </p><p> Recognizing the importance of this function, we will be happy to remember     it very often today. We will begin the day by acknowledging it, and close     the day with the thought of it in our awareness. And throughout the day     we will repeat this as often as we can: </p>     <p><i>The light of the world brings peace to every mind            through my forgiveness.        <br />    I am the means God has              appointed for the salvation of the world. </i></p><p> If you close your eyes, you will probably find it easier to let the related     thoughts come to you in the minute or two that you should devote to considering     this. Do not, however, wait for such an opportunity. No chance should be     lost for reinforcing today's idea. Remember that God's Son looks to you     for his salvation. And Who but your Self must be His Son?</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
