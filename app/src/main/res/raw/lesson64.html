The purpose of the world you see is to obscure your function     of forgiveness, and provide you with a justification for forgetting it.     It is the temptation to abandon God and His Son by taking on a physical     appearance. It is this the body's eyes look upon. </p><p> Nothing the body's eyes seem to see can be anything but a form of temptation,     since this was the purpose of the body itself. Yet we have learned that     the Holy Spirit has another use for all the illusions you have made, and     therefore He sees another purpose in them. To the Holy Spirit, the world     is a place where you learn to forgive yourself what you think of as your     sins. In this perception, the physical appearance of temptation becomes     the spiritual recognition of salvation. </p><p> To review our last few lessons, your function here is to be the light of     the world, a function given you by God. It is only the arrogance of the     ego that leads you to question this, and only the fear of the ego that induces     you to regard yourself as unworthy of the task assigned to you by God Himself.     The world's salvation awaits your forgiveness, because through it does the     Son of God escape from all illusions, and thus from all temptation. The     Son of God is you. </p><p> Only by fulfilling the function given you by God will you be happy. That     is because your function is to be happy by using the means by which happiness     becomes inevitable. There is no other way. Therefore, every time you choose     whether or not to fulfill your function, you are really choosing whether     or not to be happy. </p><p> Let us remember this today. Let us remind ourselves of it in the morning     and again at night, and all through the day as well. Prepare yourself in     advance for all the decisions you will make today by remembering they are     all really very simple. Each one will lead to happiness or unhappiness.     Can such a simple decision really be difficult to make? Let not the form     of the decision deceive you. Complexity of form does not imply complexity     of content. It is impossible that any decision on earth can have a content     different from just this one simple choice. That is the only choice the     Holy Spirit sees. Therefore it is the only choice there is. </p><p> Today, then, let us practice with these thoughts: </p>     <p><i>Let me not forget my function. <br />          Let me not try to substitute mine for God's.                    <br />          Let me forgive and be happy. </i></p><p>At least once devote ten or fifteen minutes today to reflecting on this with     closed eyes. Related thoughts will come to help you, if you remember the     crucial importance of your function to you and to the world. </p><p> In the frequent applications of today's idea throughout the day, devote several     minutes to reviewing these thoughts, and then thinking about them and about     nothing else. This will be difficult, at first particularly, since you are     not proficient in the mind discipline that it requires. You may need to     repeat "Let me not forget my function" quite often to help you     concentrate. </p><p> Two forms of shorter practice periods are required. At times, do the exercises     with your eyes closed, trying to concentrate on the thoughts you are using.     At other times, keep your eyes open after reviewing the thoughts, and then     look slowly and unselectively around you, telling yourself: </p>     <p><i>This is the world it is my function to save. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
