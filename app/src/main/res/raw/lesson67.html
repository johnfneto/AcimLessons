This is     why you are the light of the world. This is why God appointed you as the     world's savior. This is why the Son of God looks to you for his salvation.     He is saved by what you are. We will make every effort today to reach this     truth about you, and to realize fully, if only for a moment, that it is     the truth. </p><p> In the longer practice period, we will think about your reality and its wholly     unchanged and unchangeable nature. We will begin by repeating this truth     about you, and then spend a few minutes adding some relevant thoughts, such     as: </p>     <p><i>Holiness created me holy.<br />     </i><i>Kindness created me kind. <br />          Helpfulness created me helpful. <br />          Perfection created     me perfect. </i></p><p> Any attribute which is in accord with God as He defines Himself is appropriate     for use. We are trying today to undo your definition of God and replace     it with His Own. We are also trying to emphasize that you are part of His     definition of Himself. </p><p> After you have gone over several such related thoughts, try to let all thoughts     drop away for a brief preparatory interval, and then try to reach past all     your images and preconceptions about yourself to the truth in you. If love     created you like itself, this Self must be in you. And somewhere in your     mind It is there for you to find. </p><p> You may find it necessary to repeat the idea for today from time to time     to replace distracting thoughts. You may also find that this is not sufficient,     and that you need to continue adding other thoughts related to the truth     about yourself. Yet perhaps you will succeed in going past that, and through     the interval of thoughtlessness to the awareness of a blazing light in which     you recognize yourself as love created you. Be confident that you will do     much today to bring that awareness nearer, whether you feel you have succeeded     or not. </p><p> It will be particularly helpful today to practice the idea for the day as     often as you can. You need to hear the truth about yourself as frequently     as possible, because your mind is so preoccupied with false self-images.     Four or five times an hour, and perhaps even more, it would be most beneficial     to remind yourself that love created you like itself. Hear the truth about     yourself in this. </p><p> Try to realize in the shorter practice periods that this is not your tiny,     solitary voice that tells you this. This is the Voice for God, reminding     you of your Father and of your Self. This is the Voice of truth, replacing     everything that the ego tells you about yourself with the simple truth about     the Son of God. You were created by love like itself. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
