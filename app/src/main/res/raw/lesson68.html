To hold a grievance is to forget who you are. To hold a grievance     is to see yourself as a body. To hold a grievance is to let the ego rule     your mind and to condemn the body to death. Perhaps you do not yet fully     realize just what holding grievances does to your mind. It seems to split     you off from your Source and make you unlike Him. It makes you believe that     He is like what you think you have become, for no one can conceive of his     Creator as unlike himself. </p><p> Shut off from your Self, which remains aware of Its likeness to Its Creator,     your Self seems to sleep, while the part of your mind that weaves illusions     in its sleep appears to be awake. Can all this arise from holding grievances?     Oh, yes! For he who holds grievances denies he was created by love, and     his Creator has become fearful to him in his dream of hate. Who can dream     of hatred and not fear God? </p><p> It is as sure that those who hold grievances will redefine God in their own     image, as it is certain that God created them like Himself, and defined     them as part of Him. It is as sure that those who hold grievances will suffer     guilt, as it is certain that those who forgive will find peace. It is as     sure that those who hold grievances will forget who they are, as it is certain     that those who forgive will remember. </p><p> Would you not be willing to relinquish your grievances if you believed all     this were so? Perhaps you do not think you can let your grievances go. That,     however, is simply a matter of motivation. Today we will try to find out     how you would feel without them. If you succeed even by ever so little,     there will never be a problem in motivation ever again. </p><p> Begin today's extended practice period by searching your mind for those against     whom you hold what you regard as major grievances. Some of these will be     quite easy to find. Then think of the seemingly minor grievances you hold     against those you like and even think you love.  It will quickly become     apparent that there is no one against whom you do not cherish grievances     of some sort. This has left you alone in all the universe in your perception     of yourself. </p><p> Determine now to see all these people as friends.  Say to them all, thinking     of each one in turn as you do so: </p>     <p><i>I would see you as my friend, that I may remember you           are part of me and come          to know myself. </i></p><p>Spend the remainder of the practice period trying to think of yourself as     completely at peace with everyone and everything, safe in a world that protects     you and loves you, and that you love in return. Try to feel safety surrounding     you, hovering over you and holding you up. Try to believe, however briefly,     that nothing can harm you in any way. At the end of the practice period     tell yourself: </p>     <p><i>Love holds no grievances. When I let all my grievances           go I will know I am          perfectly safe. </i></p><p> The short practice periods should include a quick application of today's     idea in this form, whenever any thought of grievance arises against anyone,     physically present or not: </p>     <p><i>Love holds no grievances. Let me not betray my Self. </i></p><p>In addition, repeat the idea several times an hour in this form: </p>     <p><i>Love holds no grievances. I would wake to my Self by           laying all my grievances          aside and wakening in Him. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
