Because your grievances     are hiding the light of the world in you, everyone stands in darkness, and     you beside him. But as the veil of your grievances is lifted, you are released     with him. Share your salvation now with him who stood beside you when you     were in hell. He is your brother in the light of the world that saves you     both. </p><p> Today let us make another real attempt to reach the light in you. Before     we undertake this in our more extended practice period, let us devote several     minutes to thinking about what we are trying to do. We are literally attempting     to get in touch with the salvation of the world. We are trying to see past     the veil of darkness that keeps it concealed. We are trying to let the veil     be lifted, and to see the tears of God's Son disappear in the sunlight. </p><p> Let us begin our longer practice period today with the full realization that     this is so, and with real determination to reach what is dearer to us than     all else. Salvation is our only need. There is no other purpose here, and     no other function to fulfill. Learning salvation is our only goal. Let us     end the ancient search today by finding the light in us, and holding it     up for everyone who searches with us to look upon and rejoice. </p><p> Very quietly now, with your eyes closed, try to let go of all the content     that generally occupies your consciousness. Think of your mind as a vast     circle, surrounded by a layer of heavy, dark clouds. You can see only the     clouds because you seem to be standing outside the circle and quite apart     from it. </p><p> From where you stand, you can see no reason to believe there is a brilliant     light hidden by the clouds. The clouds seem to be the only reality. They     seem to be all there is to see. Therefore, you do not attempt to go through     them and past them, which is the only way in which you would be really convinced     of their lack of substance. We will make this attempt today. </p><p> After you have thought about the importance of what you are trying to do     for yourself and the world, try to settle down in perfect stillness, remembering     only how much you want to reach the light in you today,&ndash;now! Determine     to go past the clouds. Reach out and touch them in your mind. Brush them     aside with your hand; feel them resting on your cheeks and forehead and     eyelids as you go through them. Go on; clouds cannot stop you. </p><p> If you are doing the exercises properly, you will begin to feel a sense of     being lifted up and carried ahead. Your little effort and small determination     call on the power of the universe to help you, and God Himself will raise     you from darkness into light. You are in accord with His Will. You cannot     fail because your will is His. </p><p> Have confidence in your Father today, and be certain that He has heard you     and answered you. You may not recognize His answer yet, but you can indeed     be sure that it is given you and you will yet receive it. Try, as you attempt     to go through the clouds to the light, to hold this confidence in your mind.     Try to remember that you are at last joining your will to God's. Try to     keep the thought clearly in mind that what you undertake with God must succeed.      Then let the power of God work in you and through you, that His Will and     yours be done. </p><p> In the shorter practice periods, which you will want to do as often as possible     in view of the importance of today's idea to you and your happiness, remind     yourself that your grievances are hiding the light of the world from your     awareness. Remind yourself also that you are not searching for it alone,     and that you do know where to look for it. Say, then: </p>     <p><i>My grievances hide the light of the world in me.  I cannot           see what I have          hidden. Yet I want to let it be revealed to           me, for my salvation and                    the salvation of the world. </i></p><p>Also, be sure to tell yourself: </p>     <p><i>If I hold this grievance the light of the world will be hidden      from me, </i></p><p>if you are tempted to hold anything against anyone today. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
