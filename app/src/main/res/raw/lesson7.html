Yet it is the rationale     for all of the preceding ones. </p>     <p>It is the reason why nothing that you see means anything.<br />          It is the reason          why you have given everything you see all the meaning that it has for          you. <br />          It is the reason why you do not understand anything you see. <br />          It          is the reason why your thoughts do not mean anything, and why they          are like the things you see. <br />          It is the reason why you are never upset          for the reason you think. <br />          It is the reason why you are upset because     you see something that is not there. </p><p> Old ideas about time are very difficult to change, because everything you     believe is rooted in time, and depends on your not learning these new ideas     about it. Yet that is precisely why you need new ideas about time. This     first time idea is not really so strange as it may sound at first. </p><p> Look at a cup, for example. Do you see a cup, or are you merely reviewing     your past experiences of picking up a cup, being thirsty, drinking from     a cup, feeling the rim of a cup against your lips, having breakfast and     so on? Are not your aesthetic reactions to the cup, too, based on past experiences?     How else would you know whether or not this kind of cup will break if you     drop it? What do you know about this cup except what you learned in the     past? You would have no idea what this cup is, except for your past learning.     Do you, then, really see it? </p><p> Look about you. This is equally true of whatever you look at. Acknowledge     this by applying the idea for today indiscriminately to whatever catches     your eye. For example: </p>     <p><i>I see only the past in this pencil.<br />     </i><i>I see only the past in this shoe. <br />          I see only the past in this hand. <br />          I see     only the past in that body. <br />     I see only the past in that face. </i></p><p> Do not linger over any one thing in particular, but remember to omit nothing     specifically. Glance briefly at each subject, and then move on to the next.     Three or four practice periods, each to last a minute or so, will be enough. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
