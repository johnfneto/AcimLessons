Salvation seems to come from anywhere except     from you. So, too, does the source of guilt. You see neither guilt nor salvation     as in your own mind and nowhere else. When you realize that all guilt is     solely an invention of your mind, you also realize that guilt and salvation     must be in the same place. In understanding this you are saved. </p><p> The seeming cost of accepting today's idea is this: It means that nothing     outside yourself can save you; nothing outside yourself can give you peace.     But it also means that nothing outside yourself can hurt you, or disturb     your peace or upset you in any way. Today's idea places you in charge of     the universe, where you belong because of what you are. This is not a role     that can be partially accepted. And you must surely begin to see that accepting     it is salvation. </p><p> It may not, however, be clear to you why the recognition that guilt is in     your own mind entails the realization that salvation is there as well. God     would not have put the remedy for the sickness where it cannot help. That     is the way your mind has worked, but hardly His. He wants you to be healed,     so He has kept the Source of healing where the need for healing lies. </p><p> You have tried to do just the opposite, making every attempt, however distorted     and fantastic it might be, to separate healing from the sickness for which     it was intended, and thus keep the sickness. Your purpose was to ensure     that healing did not occur. God's purpose was to ensure that it did. </p><p> Today we practice realizing that God's Will and ours are really the same     in this. God wants us to be healed, and we do not really want to be sick,     because it makes us unhappy. Therefore, in accepting the idea for today,     we are really in agreement with God. He does not want us to be sick. Neither     do we. He wants us to be healed. So do we. </p><p> We are ready for two longer practice periods today, each of which should     last some ten to fifteen minutes. We will, however, still let you decide     when to undertake them. We will follow this practice for a number of lessons,     and it would again be well to decide in advance when would be a good time     to lay aside for each of them, and then adhering to your own decisions as     closely as possible. </p><p>Begin these practice periods by repeating the idea for today, adding a statement     signifying your recognition that salvation comes from nothing outside of     you. You might put it this way: </p>     <p><i>My salvation comes from me.  It cannot come from      anywhere else. </i></p><p>Then devote a few minutes, with your eyes closed, to reviewing some of the     external places where you have looked for salvation in the past;&ndash;in     other people, in possessions, in various situations and events, and in self-concepts     that you sought to make real. Recognize that it is not there, and tell yourself: </p>     <p><i>My salvation cannot come from any of these things.  <br />          My salvation comes from          me and only from me. </i></p><p> Now we will try again to reach the light in you, which is where your salvation     is. You cannot find it in the clouds that surround the light, and it is     in them you have been looking for it. It is not there. It is past the clouds     and in the light beyond. Remember that you will have to go through the clouds     before you can reach the light.  But remember also that you have never     found anything in the cloud patterns you imagined that endured, or that     you wanted. </p><p> Since all illusions of salvation have failed you, surely you do not want     to remain in the clouds, looking vainly for idols there, when you could     so easily walk on into the light of real salvation. Try to pass the clouds     by whatever means appeals to you. If it helps you, think of me holding your     hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy. </p><p> For the short and frequent practice periods today, remind yourself that your     salvation comes from you, and nothing but your own thoughts can hamper your     progress. You are free from all external interference. You are in charge     of your salvation. You are in charge of the salvation of the world. Say,     then: </p>     <p><i>My salvation comes from me. Nothing outside of me can hold           me back.               Within me is the world's salvation and my own. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
