Each has imprisoned you with laws as senseless as itself. You     are not bound by them. Yet to understand that this is so, you must first     realize salvation lies not there. While you would seek for it in things     that have no meaning, you bind yourself to laws that make no sense. Thus     do you seek to prove salvation is where it is not. </p><p> Today we will be glad you cannot prove it. For if you could, you would forever     seek salvation where it is not, and never find it. The idea for today tells     you once again how simple is salvation. Look for it where it waits for you,     and there it will be found. Look nowhere else, for it is nowhere else. </p><p> Think of the freedom in the recognition that you are not bound by all the     strange and twisted laws you have set up to save you. You really think that     you would starve unless you have stacks of green paper strips and piles     of metal discs. You really think a small round pellet or some fluid pushed     into your veins through a sharpened needle will ward off disease and death.     You really think you are alone unless another body is with you. </p><p> It is insanity that thinks these things. You call them laws, and put them     under different names in a long catalogue of rituals that have no use and     serve no purpose. You think you must obey the "laws" of medicine,     of economics and of health. Protect the body, and you will be saved. </p><p> These are not laws, but madness. The body is endangered by the mind that     hurts itself. The body suffers just in order that the mind will fail to     see it is the victim of itself. The body's suffering is a mask the mind     holds up to hide what really suffers. It would not understand it is its     own enemy; that it attacks itself and wants to die. It is from this your "laws" would     save the body. It is for this you think you are a body. </p><p> There are no laws except the laws of God. This needs repeating, over and     over, until you realize it applies to everything that you have made in opposition     to God's Will. Your magic has no meaning. What it is meant to save does     not exist. Only what it is meant to hide will save you. </p><p> The laws of God can never be replaced. We will devote today to rejoicing     that this is so. It is no longer a truth that we would hide. We realize     instead it is a truth that keeps us free forever. Magic imprisons, but the     laws of God make free. The light has come because there are no laws but     His. </p><p> We will begin the longer practice periods today with a short review of the     different kinds of "laws" we have believed we must obey. These     would include, for example, the "laws" of nutrition, of immunization,     of medication, and of the body's protection in innumerable ways. Think further;     you believe in the "laws" of friendship, of "good" relationships     and reciprocity. Perhaps you even think that there are laws which set forth     what is God's and what is yours. Many "religions" have been based     on this. They would not save but damn in Heaven's name. Yet they are no     more strange than other "laws" you hold must be obeyed to make     you safe. </p><p> There are no laws but God's. Dismiss all foolish magical beliefs today, and     hold your mind in silent readiness to hear the Voice that speaks the truth     to you. You will be listening to One Who says there is no loss under the     laws of God. Payment is neither given nor received. Exchange cannot be made;     there are no substitutes; and nothing is replaced by something else. God's     laws forever give and never take. </p><p> Hear Him Who tells you this, and realize how foolish are the "laws" you     thought upheld the world you thought you saw. Then listen further. He will     tell you more. About the Love your Father has for you. About the endless     joy He offers you. About His yearning for His only Son, created as His channel     for creation; denied to Him by his belief in hell. </p><p> Let us today open God's channels to Him, and let His Will extend through     us to Him. Thus is creation endlessly increased. His Voice will speak of     this to us, as well as of the joys of Heaven which His laws keep limitless     forever. We will repeat today's idea until we have listened and understood     there are no laws but God's. Then we will tell ourselves, as a dedication     with which the practice period concludes: </p><p align="center"><i>I am under no laws but God's. </i></p><p> We will repeat this dedication as often as possible today; at least four     or five times an hour, as well as in response to any temptation to experience     ourselves as subject to other laws throughout the day. It is our statement     of freedom from all danger and all tyranny. It is our acknowledgment that     God is our Father, and that His Son is saved. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
