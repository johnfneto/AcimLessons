Each grievance stands like a dark     shield of hate before the miracle it would conceal. And as you raise it     up before your eyes, you will not see the miracle beyond. Yet all the while     it waits for you in light, but you behold your grievances instead. </p><p> Today we go beyond the grievances, to look upon the miracle instead. We will     reverse the way you see by not allowing sight to stop before it sees. We     will not wait before the shield of hate, but lay it down and gently lift     our eyes in silence to behold the Son of God. </p><p> He waits for you behind your grievances, and as you lay them down he will     appear in shining light where each one stood before. For every grievance     is a block to sight, and as it lifts you see the Son of God where he has     always been. He stands in light, but you were in the dark. Each grievance     made the darkness deeper, and you could not see. </p><p> Today we will attempt to see God's Son. We will not let ourselves be blind     to him; we will not look upon our grievances. So is the seeing of the world     reversed, as we look out toward truth, away from fear. We will select one     person you have used as target for your grievances, and lay the grievances     aside and look at him. Someone, perhaps, you fear and even hate; someone     you think you love who angered you; someone you call a friend, but whom     you see as difficult at times or hard to please, demanding, irritating or     untrue to the ideal he should accept as his, according to the role you set     for him. </p><p> You know the one to choose; his name has crossed your mind already. He will     be the one of whom we ask God's Son be shown to you. Through seeing him     behind the grievances that you have held against him, you will learn that     what lay hidden while you saw him not is there in everyone, and can be seen.     He who was enemy is more than friend when he is freed to take the holy role     the Holy Spirit has assigned to him. Let him be savior unto you today. Such     is his role in God your Father's plan. </p><p> Our longer practice periods today will see him in this role. You will attempt     to hold him in your mind, first as you now consider him. You will review     his faults, the difficulties you have had with him, the pain he caused you,     his neglect, and all the little and the larger hurts he gave. You will regard     his body with its flaws and better points as well, and you will think of     his mistakes and even of his "sins." </p><p> Then let us ask of Him Who knows this Son of God in his reality and truth,     that we may look on him a different way, and see our savior shining in the     light of true forgiveness, given unto us. We ask Him in the holy Name of     God and of His Son, as holy as Himself: </p>     <p><i>Let me behold my savior in this one You have appointed as           the one for me to          ask to lead me to the holy light in which he           stands, that I may join with          him. </i></p><p>The body's eyes are closed, and as you think of him who grieved you, let your     mind be shown the light in him beyond your grievances. </p><p> What you have asked for cannot be denied. Your savior has been waiting long     for this. He would be free, and make his freedom yours. The Holy Spirit     leans from him to you, seeing no separation in God's Son. And what you see     through Him will free you both. Be very quiet now, and look upon your shining     savior. No dark grievances obscure the sight of him. You have allowed the     Holy Spirit to express through him the role God gave Him that you might     be saved. </p><p> God thanks you for these quiet times today in which you laid your images     aside, and looked upon the miracle of love the Holy Spirit showed you in     their place. The world and Heaven join in thanking you, for not one Thought     of God but must rejoice as you are saved, and all the world with you. </p><p> We will remember this throughout the day, and take the role assigned to us     as part of God's salvation plan, and not our own. Temptation falls away     when we allow each one we meet to save us, and refuse to hide his light     behind our grievances. To everyone you meet, and to the ones you think of     or remember from the past, allow the role of savior to be given, that you     may share it with him. For you both, and all the sightless ones as well,     we pray: </p><p align="center"><i>Let miracles replace all grievances. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
