<p align="center"><b>My mind is preoccupied with past thoughts. </b></p>
<p> This idea is, of course, the reason why you see only the past. No one really
     sees anything. He sees only his thoughts projected outward. The mind's preoccupation
     with the past is the cause of the misconception about time from which your
     seeing suffers. Your mind cannot grasp the present, which is the only time
     there is. It therefore cannot understand time, and cannot, in fact, understand
     anything. </p>
<p> The one wholly true thought one can hold about the past is that it is not
     here. To think about it at all is therefore to think about illusions. Very
     few have realized what is actually entailed in picturing the past or in
     anticipating the future. The mind is actually blank when it does this, because
     it is not really thinking about anything. </p>
<p> The purpose of the exercises for today is to begin to train your mind to
     recognize when it is not really thinking at all. While thoughtless ideas
     preoccupy your mind, the truth is blocked. Recognizing that your mind has
     been merely blank, rather than believing that it is filled with real ideas,
     is the first step to opening the way to vision. </p>
<p> The exercises for today should be done with eyes closed. This is because
     you actually cannot see anything, and it is easier to recognize that no
     matter how vividly you may picture a thought, you are not seeing anything.
     With as little investment as possible, search your mind for the usual minute
     or so, merely noting the thoughts you find there. Name each one by the central
     figure or theme it contains, and pass on to the next. Introduce the practice
     period by saying: </p>

     <p><i>I seem to be thinking about ___. </i></p>

<p> Then name each of your thoughts specifically, for example: </p>

     <p><i>I seem to be thinking about [name of a person], about [name of an object],
          about [name of an emotion], </i></p>

<p>and so on, concluding at the end of the mind-searching period with: </p>

     <p><i>But my mind is preoccupied with past thoughts. </i></p>

<p>This can be done four or five times during the day, unless you find it irritates
     you. If you find it trying, three or four times is sufficient. You might
     find it helpful, however, to include your irritation, or any emotion that
     the idea for today may induce, in the mind searching itself. </p>
