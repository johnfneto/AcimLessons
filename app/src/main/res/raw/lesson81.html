We will begin where our     last review left off, and cover two ideas each day. The earlier part of     each day will be devoted to one of these ideas, and the latter part of the     day to the other. We will have one longer exercise period, and frequent     shorter ones in which we practice each of them. </p><p>The longer practice periods will follow this general form:     Take about fifteen minutes for each of them, and begin by thinking about     the ideas for the day, and the comments that are included in the assignments.     Devote some three or four minutes to reading them over slowly, several times     if you wish, and then close your eyes and listen. </p><p>Repeat the first phase of the exercise period if you find your     mind wandering, but try to spend the major part of the time listening quietly     but attentively. There is a message waiting for you. Be confident that you     will receive it. Remember that it belongs to you, and that you want it. </p><p>Do not allow your intent to waver in the face of distracting     thoughts. Realize that, whatever form such thoughts may take, they have     no meaning and no power. Replace them with your determination to succeed.     Do not forget that your will has power over all fantasies and dreams. Trust     it to see you through, and carry you beyond them all. </p><p>Regard these practice periods as dedications to the way, the     truth and the life. Refuse to be sidetracked into detours, illusions and     thoughts of death. You are dedicated to salvation. Be determined each day     not to leave your function unfulfilled. </p><p>Reaffirm your determination in the shorter practice periods     as well, using the original form of the idea for general applications, and     more specific forms when needed. Some specific forms are included in the     comments which follow the statement of the ideas. These, however, are merely     suggestions. It is not the particular words you use that matter. </p><hr /><p align="center"><a name="lesson_81" id="lesson_81"></a><b>Lesson 81</b></p><p align="center">Our ideas for review today are: </p><p><b>(61) I am the light of the world. </b></p><p>How holy am I, who have been given the function of lighting up the world!     Let me be still before my holiness. In its calm light let all my conflicts     disappear. In its peace let me remember Who I am. </p><p>Some specific forms for applying this idea when special difficulties seem     to arise might be: </p>     <p><i>Let me not obscure the light of the world in me. <br />          Let the light of the world          shine through this appearance. <br />          This shadow will vanish before the light. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(62) Forgiveness is my function as the light of the world. </b></p><p>It is through accepting my function that I will see the light in me. And in     this light will my function stand clear and perfectly unambiguous before     my sight. My acceptance does not depend on my recognizing what my function     is, for I do not yet understand forgiveness. Yet I will trust that, in the     light, I will see it as it is. </p><p>Specific forms for using this idea might include: </p>     <p><i>Let this help me learn what forgiveness means.<br />     </i><i>Let me not separate my function from my will. <br />          I will not use this for an alien     purpose. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
