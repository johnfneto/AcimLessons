I cannot suffer, I cannot experience loss     and I cannot die. I am not a body. I would recognize my reality today. I     will worship no idols, nor raise my own self-concept to replace my Self.     I am in the likeness of my Creator. Love created me like itself. </p><p>You might find these specific forms helpful in applying the idea: </p>     <p><i>Let me not see an illusion of myself in this.<br />     </i><i>As I look on this, let me remember my Creator. <br />          My Creator did not create this     as I see it. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(68) Love holds no grievances. </b></p><p>Grievances are completely alien to love. Grievances attack love and keep its     light obscure. If I hold grievances I am attacking love, and therefore attacking     my Self. My Self thus becomes alien to me. I am determined not to attack     my Self today, so that I can remember Who I am. </p><p>These specific forms for applying this idea would be helpful: </p>     <p><i>This is no justification for denying my Self.<br />     </i><i>I will not use this to attack love. <br />          Let this not tempt me to attack myself. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;
