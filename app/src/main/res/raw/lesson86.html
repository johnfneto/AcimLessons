I have seen it     in many people and in many things, but when I reached for it, it was not     there. I was mistaken about where it is. I was mistaken about what it is.     I will undertake no more idle seeking. Only God's plan for salvation will     work. And I will rejoice because His plan can never fail. </p><p>These are some suggested forms for applying this idea specifically: </p>     <p><i>God's plan for salvation will save me from my perception of this.<br />     </i><i>This is no exception in God's plan for my salvation. <br />          Let me perceive this     only in the light of God's plan for salvation. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(72) Holding grievances is an attack on God's plan for salvation. </b></p><p>Holding grievances is an attempt to prove that God's plan for salvation will     not work. Yet only His plan will work. By holding grievances, I am therefore     excluding my only hope of salvation from my awareness. I would no longer     defeat my own best interests in this insane way. I would accept God's plan     for salvation, and be happy. </p><p>Specific applications for this idea might be in these forms: </p>     <p><i>I am choosing between misperception and salvation as I look on this.<br />     </i><i>If I see grounds for grievances in this, I will not see the grounds for my     salvation. <br />     This calls for salvation, not attack. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
