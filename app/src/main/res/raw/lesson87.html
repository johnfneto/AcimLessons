It is not my will to grope about in     darkness, fearful of shadows and afraid of things unseen and unreal. Light     shall be my guide today. I will follow it where it leads me, and I will     look only on what it shows me. This day I will experience the peace of true     perception. </p><p>These forms of this idea would be helpful for specific applications: </p>     <p><i>This cannot hide the light I will to see. <br />          You stand with me in light, [name].                    <br />          In the light this will look different. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(74) There is no will but God's. </b></p><p>I am safe today because there is no will but God's. I can become afraid only     when I believe there is another will. I try to attack only when I am afraid,     and only when I try to attack can I believe that my eternal safety is threatened.     Today I will recognize that all this has not occurred. I am safe because     there is no will but God's. </p><p>These are some useful forms of this idea for specific applications: </p>     <p><i>Let me perceive this in accordance with the Will of God.<br />     </i><i>It is God's Will you are His Son, [name], and mine as well. <br />          This is part of     God's Will for me, however I may see it. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
