Salvation is a decision made already. Attack and grievances     are not there to choose. That is why I always choose between truth and illusion;     between what is there and what is not. The light has come. I can but choose     the light, for it has no alternative. It has replaced the darkness, and     the darkness has gone. </p><p>These would prove useful forms for specific applications of this idea: </p>     <p><i>This cannot show me darkness, for the light has come.<br />     </i><i>The light in you is all that I would see, [name]. <br />          I would see in this only     what is there. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(76) I am under no laws but God's. </b></p><p>Here is the perfect statement of my freedom. I am under no laws but God's.     I am constantly tempted to make up other laws and give them power over me.     I suffer only because of my belief in them. They have no real effect on     me at all. I am perfectly free of the effects of all laws save God's. And     His are the laws of freedom. </p><p>For specific forms in applying this idea, these would be useful: </p>     <p><i>My perception of this shows me I believe in laws that do not exist.<br />     </i><i>I see only the laws of God at work in this. <br />          Let me allow God's laws to work     in this, and not my own. </i></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
