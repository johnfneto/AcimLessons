		   <font face="verdana" size="4"> <h3 p align="center">Lesson 89</h3>    <p align="center">These are our review ideas for today: </p><p><b>(77) I am entitled to miracles. </b></p><p>I am entitled to miracles because I am under no laws but God's. His laws release     me from all grievances, and replace them with miracles. And I would accept     the miracles in place of the grievances, which are but illusions that hide     the miracles beyond. Now I would accept only what the laws of God entitle     me to have, that I may use it on behalf of the function He has given me. </p><p>You might use these suggestions for specific applications of this idea: </p>     <p><i>Behind this is a miracle to which I am entitled. <br />          Let me not hold a grievance          against you, [name],           but offer you the miracle that belongs to you instead.<br />          Seen truly, this offers me a miracle. </i></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(78) Let miracles replace all grievances. </b></p><p>By this idea do I unite my will with the Holy Spirit's, and perceive them     as one. By this idea do I accept my release from hell. By this idea do I     express my willingness to have all my illusions be replaced with truth,     according to God's plan for my salvation. I would make no exceptions and     no substitutes. I want all of Heaven and only Heaven, as God wills me to     have. </p><p>Useful specific forms for applying this idea would be: </p>     <p><i>I would not hold this grievance apart from my salvation.<br />     </i><i>Let our grievances be replaced by miracles, [name]. <br />          Beyond this is the miracle     by which all my grievances are replaced. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
