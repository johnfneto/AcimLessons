			</p><p> This idea obviously follows from the two preceding ones. But while you may     be able to accept it intellectually, it is unlikely that it will mean anything     to you as yet. However, understanding is not necessary at this point. In     fact, the recognition that you do not understand is a prerequisite for undoing     your false ideas. These exercises are concerned with practice, not with     understanding. You do not need to practice what you already understand.     It would indeed be circular to aim at understanding, and assume that you     have it already. </p><p> It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what it seems to picture     is not there. This idea can be quite disturbing, and may meet with active     resistance in any number of forms. Yet that does not preclude applying it.     No more than that is required for these or any other exercises. Each small     step will clear a little of the darkness away, and understanding will finally     come to lighten every corner of the mind that has been cleared of the debris     that darkens it. </p><p> These exercises, for which three or four practice periods are sufficient,     involve looking about you and applying the idea for the day to whatever     you see, remembering the need for its indiscriminate application, and the     essential rule of excluding nothing. For example: </p>     <p><i>I do not see this typewriter as it is now. <br />          I do not see this telephone as          it is now. <br />          I do not see this arm as it is now. </i></p><p> Begin with things that are nearest you, and then extend the range outward: </p>     <p><i>I do not see that coat rack as it is now.<br />     </i><i>I do not see that door as it is now. <br />          I do not see that face as it is now. </i></p><p>It is emphasized again that while complete inclusion should not be attempted,     specific exclusion must be avoided. Be sure you are honest with yourself     in making this distinction. You may be tempted to obscure it. </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
