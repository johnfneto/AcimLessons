Let me also understand that the solution is always a miracle     with which I let the grievance be replaced. Today I would remember the simplicity     of salvation by reinforcing the lesson that there is one problem and one     solution. The problem is a grievance; the solution is a miracle. And I invite     the solution to come to me through my forgiveness of the grievance, and     my welcome of the miracle that takes its place. </p><p>Specific applications of this idea might be in these forms: </p>     <p><i>This presents a problem to me which I would have resolved. <br />          The miracle behind          this grievance will resolve it for me. <br />          The answer to this problem is the          miracle that it conceals. </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>(80) Let me recognize my problems have been solved. </b></p><p>I seem to have problems only because I am misusing time. I believe that the     problem comes first, and time must elapse before it can be worked out. I     do not see the problem and the answer as simultaneous in their occurrence.     That is because I do not yet realize that God has placed the answer together     with the problem, so that they cannot be separated by time. The Holy Spirit     will teach me this, if I will let Him. And I will understand it is impossible     that I could have a problem which has not been solved already. </p><p>These forms of the idea will be useful for specific applications: </p>     <p><i>I need not wait for this to be resolved.<br />     </i><i>The answer to this problem is already given me, if I will accept it. <br />          Time     cannot separate this problem from its solution. </i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
