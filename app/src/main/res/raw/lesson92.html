You do not think     of light in terms of strength, and darkness in terms of weakness. That is     because your idea of what seeing means is tied up with the body and its     eyes and brain. Thus you believe that you can change what you see by putting     little bits of glass before your eyes. This is among the many magical beliefs     that come from the conviction you are a body, and the body's eyes can see. </p><p> You also believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the nature     of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea. It is as if you thought     you held the match that lights the sun and gives it all its warmth; or that     you held the world within your hand, securely bound until you let it go.     Yet this is no more foolish than to believe the body's eyes can see; the     brain can think. </p><p> It is God's strength in you that is the light in which you see, as it is     His Mind with which you think. His strength denies your weakness. It is     your weakness that sees through the body's eyes, peering about in darkness     to behold the likeness of itself; the small, the weak, the sickly and the     dying, those in need, the helpless and afraid, the sad, the poor, the starving     and the joyless. These are seen through eyes that cannot see and cannot     bless. </p><p> Strength overlooks these things by seeing past appearances. It keeps its     steady gaze upon the light that lies beyond them. It unites with light,     of which it is a part. It sees itself. It brings the light in which your     Self appears. In darkness you perceive a self that is not there. Strength     is the truth about you; weakness is an idol falsely worshipped and adored     that strength may be dispelled, and darkness rule where God appointed that     there should be light. </p><p> Strength comes from truth, and shines with light its Source has given it;     weakness reflects the darkness of its maker. It is sick and looks on sickness,     which is like itself. Truth is a savior and can only will for happiness     and peace for everyone. It gives its strength to everyone who asks, in limitless     supply. It sees that lack in anyone would be a lack in all. And so it gives     its light that all may see and benefit as one. Its strength is shared, that     it may bring to all the miracle in which they will unite in purpose and     forgiveness and in love. </p><p> Weakness, which looks in darkness, cannot see a purpose in forgiveness and     in love. It sees all others different from itself, and nothing in the world     that it would share. It judges and condemns, but does not love. In darkness     it remains to hide itself, and dreams that it is strong and conquering,     a victor over limitations that but grow in darkness to enormous size. </p><p> It fears and it attacks and hates itself, and darkness covers everything     it sees, leaving its dreams as fearful as itself. No miracles are here,     but only hate. It separates itself from what it sees, while light and strength     perceive themselves as one. The light of strength is not the light you see.     It does not change and flicker and go out. It does not shift from night     to day, and back to darkness till the morning comes again. </p><p> The light of strength is constant, sure as love, forever glad to give itself     away, because it cannot give but to itself. No one can ask in vain to share     its sight, and none who enters its abode can leave without a miracle before     his eyes, and strength and light abiding in his heart. </p><p> The strength in you will offer you the light, and guide your seeing so you     do not dwell on idle shadows that the body's eyes provide for self-deception.     Strength and light unite in you, and where they meet, your Self stands ready     to embrace you as Its Own. Such is the meeting place we try today to find     and rest in, for the peace of God is where your Self, His Son, is waiting     now to meet Itself again, and be as One. </p><p> Let us give twenty minutes twice today to join this meeting. Let yourself     be brought unto your Self. Its strength will be the light in which the gift     of sight is given you. Leave, then, the dark a little while today, and we     will practice seeing in the light, closing the body's eyes and asking truth     to show us how to find the meeting place of self and Self, where light and     strength are one. </p><p> Morning and evening we will practice thus. After the morning meeting, we     will use the day in preparation for the time at night when we will meet     again in trust. Let us repeat as often as we can the idea for today, and     recognize that we are being introduced to sight, and led away from darkness     to the light where only miracles can be perceived. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
