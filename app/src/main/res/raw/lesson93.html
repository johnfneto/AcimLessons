You think if anyone     could see the truth about you he would be repelled, recoiling from you as     if from a poisonous snake. You think if what is true about you were revealed     to you, you would be struck with horror so intense that you would rush to     death by your own hand, living on after seeing this being impossible. </p><p> These are beliefs so firmly fixed that it is difficult to help you see that     they are based on nothing. That you have made mistakes is obvious. That     you have sought salvation in strange ways; have been deceived, deceiving     and afraid of foolish fantasies and savage dreams; and have bowed down to     idols made of dust,&ndash;all this is true by what you now believe. </p><p> Today we question this, not from the point of view of what you think, but     from a very different reference point, from which such idle thoughts are     meaningless. These thoughts are not according to God's Will. These weird     beliefs He does not share with you. This is enough to prove that they are     wrong, but you do not perceive that this is so. </p><p> Why would you not be overjoyed to be assured that all the evil that you think     you did was never done, that all your sins are nothing, that you are as     pure and holy as you were created, and that light and joy and peace abide     in you? Your image of yourself cannot withstand the Will of God. You think     that this is death, but it is life. You think you are destroyed, but you     are saved. </p><p> The self you made is not the Son of God. Therefore, this self does not exist     at all. And anything it seems to do and think means nothing. It is neither     bad nor good. It is unreal, and nothing more than that. It does not battle     with the Son of God. It does not hurt him, nor attack his peace. It has     not changed creation, nor reduced eternal sinlessness to sin, and love to     hate. What power can this self you made possess, when it would contradict     the Will of God? </p><p> Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God. Over and over this must be repeated,     until it is accepted. It is true. Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God.     Nothing can touch it, or change what God created as eternal. The self you     made, evil and full of sin, is meaningless. Your sinlessness is guaranteed     by God, and light and joy and peace abide in you. </p><p> Salvation requires the acceptance of but one thought;&ndash;you are as God     created you, not what you made of yourself. Whatever evil you may think     you did, you are as God created you. Whatever mistakes you made, the truth     about you is unchanged. Creation is eternal and unalterable. Your sinlessness     is guaranteed by God. You are and will forever be exactly as you were created.     Light and joy and peace abide in you because God put them there. </p><p> In our longer exercise periods today, which would be most profitable if done     for the first five minutes of every waking hour, begin by stating the truth     about your creation: </p>     <p><i>Light and joy and peace abide in me.<br />     My sinlessness is guaranteed by God. </i></p><p>Then put away your foolish self-images, and spend the rest of the practice     period in trying to experience what God has given you, in place of what     you have decreed for yourself. </p><p> You are what God created or what you made. One Self is true; the other is     not there. Try to experience the unity of your one Self. Try to appreciate     Its Holiness and the love from which It was created. Try not to interfere     with the Self which God created as you, by hiding Its majesty behind the     tiny idols of evil and sinfulness you have made to replace It. Let It come     into Its Own. Here you are; This is You. And light and joy and peace abide     in you because this is so. </p><p> You may not be willing or even able to use the first five minutes of each     hour for these exercises. Try, however, to do so when you can. At least     remember to repeat these thoughts each hour: </p>     <p><i>Light and joy and peace abide in me.<br />     </i><i>My sinlessness is guaranteed by God. </i></p><p>Then try to devote at least a minute or so to closing your eyes and realizing     that this is a statement of the truth about you. </p><p> If a situation arises that seems to be disturbing, quickly dispel the illusion     of fear by repeating these thoughts again. Should you be tempted to become     angry with someone, tell him silently: </p>     <p><i>Light and joy and peace abide in you.<br />     </i><i>Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God. </i></p><p>You can do much for the world's salvation today. You can do much today to     bring you closer to the part in salvation that God has assigned to you.     And you can do much today to bring the conviction to your mind that the     idea for the day is true indeed. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
