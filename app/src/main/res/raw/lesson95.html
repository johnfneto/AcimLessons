		    <font face="verdana" size="4"><h3 p align="center">Lesson 95</h3>    <p align="center"><b>I am one Self, united with my Creator. </b></p><p> Today's idea accurately describes you as God created you. You are one within     yourself, and one with Him. Yours is the unity of all creation. Your perfect     unity makes change in you impossible. You do not accept this, and you fail     to realize it must be so, only because you believe that you have changed     yourself already. </p><p> You see yourself as a ridiculous parody on God's creation; weak, vicious,     ugly and sinful, miserable and beset with pain. Such is your version of     yourself; a self divided into many warring parts, separate from God, and     tenuously held together by its erratic and capricious maker, to which you     pray. It does not hear your prayers, for it is deaf. It does not see the     oneness in you, for it is blind. It does not understand you are the Son     of God, for it is senseless and understands nothing. </p><p> We will attempt today to be aware only of what can hear and see, and what     makes perfect sense. We will again direct our exercises towards reaching     your one Self, which is united with Its Creator. In patience and in hope     we try again today. </p><p> The use of the first five minutes of every waking hour for practicing the     idea for the day has special advantages at the stage of learning in which     you are at present. It is difficult at this point not to allow your mind     to wander, if it undertakes extended practice. You have surely realized     this by now. You have seen the extent of your lack of mental discipline,     and of your need for mind training. It is necessary that you be aware of     this, for it is indeed a hindrance to your advance. </p><p> Frequent but shorter practice periods have other advantages for you at this     time. In addition to recognizing your difficulties with sustained attention,     you must also have noticed that, unless you are reminded of your purpose     frequently, you tend to forget about it for long periods of time. You often     fail to remember the short applications of the idea for the day, and you     have not yet formed the habit of using the idea as an automatic response     to temptation. </p><p> Structure, then, is necessary for you at this time, planned to include frequent     reminders of your goal and regular attempts to reach it. Regularity in terms     of time is not the ideal requirement for the most beneficial form of practice     in salvation. It is advantageous, however, for those whose motivation is     inconsistent, and who remain heavily defended against learning. </p><p> We will, therefore, keep to the five-minutes-an-hour practice periods for     a while, and urge you to omit as few as possible. Using the first five minutes     of the hour will be particularly helpful, since it imposes firmer structure.     Do not, however, use your lapses from this schedule as an excuse not to     return to it again as soon as you can. There may well be a temptation to     regard the day as lost because you have already failed to do what is required.     This should, however, merely be recognized as what it is; a refusal to let     your mistake be corrected, and an unwillingness to try again. </p><p> The Holy Spirit is not delayed in His teaching by your mistakes. He can be     held back only by your unwillingness to let them go. Let us therefore be     determined, particularly for the next week or so, to be willing to forgive     ourselves for our lapses in diligence, and our failures to follow the instructions     for practicing the day's idea. This tolerance for weakness will enable us     to overlook it, rather than give it power to delay our learning. If we give     it power to do this, we are regarding it as strength, and are confusing     strength with weakness. </p><p> When you fail to comply with the requirements of this course, you have merely     made a mistake. This calls for correction, and for nothing else. To allow     a mistake to continue is to make additional mistakes, based on the first     and reinforcing it. It is this process that must be laid aside, for it is     but another way in which you would defend illusions against the truth. </p><p> Let all these errors go by recognizing them for what they are. They are attempts     to keep you unaware you are one Self, united with your Creator, at one with     every aspect of creation, and limitless in power and in peace. This is the     truth, and nothing else is true. Today we will affirm this truth again,     and try to reach the place in you in which there is no doubt that only this     is true. </p><p> Begin the practice periods today with this assurance, offered to your mind     with all the certainty that you can give: </p>     <p><i>I am one Self, united with my Creator, at one with every           aspect of creation,          and limitless in power and in peace. </i></p><p>Then close your eyes and tell yourself again, slowly and thoughtfully, attempting     to allow the meaning of the words to sink into your mind, replacing false     ideas: </p><p align="center"><i>I am one Self. </i></p><p>Repeat this several times, and then attempt to feel     the meaning that the words convey. </p><p> You are one Self, united and secure in light and joy and peace. You are God's     Son, one Self, with one Creator and one goal; to bring awareness of this     oneness to all minds, that true creation may extend the allness and the     unity of God. You are one Self, complete and healed and whole, with power     to lift the veil of darkness from the world, and let the light in you come     through to teach the world the truth about yourself. </p><p> You are one Self, in perfect harmony with all there is, and all that there     will be. You are one Self, the holy Son of God, united with your brothers     in that Self; united with your Father in His Will. Feel this one Self in     you, and let It shine away all your illusions and your doubts. This is your     Self, the Son of God Himself, sinless as Its Creator, with His strength     within you and His Love forever yours. You are one Self, and it is given     you to feel this Self within you, and to cast all your illusions out of     the one Mind that is this Self, the holy truth in you. </p><p> Do not forget today. We need your help; your little part in bringing happiness     to all the world. And Heaven looks to you in confidence that you will try     today. Share, then, its surety, for it is yours. Be vigilant. Do not forget     today. Throughout the day do not forget your goal. Repeat today's idea as     frequently as possible, and understand each time you do so, someone hears     the voice of hope, the stirring of the truth within his mind, the gentle     rustling of the wings of peace. </p><p> Your own acknowledgment you are one Self, united with your Father, is a call     to all the world to be at one with you. To everyone you meet today, be sure     to give the promise of today's idea and tell him this: </p>     <p><i>You are one Self with me, united with our Creator in this Self. <br />          I honor you          because of What I am, and What He is,          Who loves us both as One. </i></p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
