This sense of being split into opposites     induces feelings of acute and constant conflict, and leads to frantic attempts     to reconcile the contradictory aspects of this self-perception. You have     sought many such solutions, and none of them has worked. The opposites you     see in you will never be compatible. But one exists. </p><p> The fact that truth and illusion cannot be reconciled, no matter how you     try, what means you use and where you see the problem, must be accepted     if you would be saved. Until you have accepted this, you will attempt an     endless list of goals you cannot reach; a senseless series of expenditures     of time and effort, hopefulness and doubt, each one as futile as the one     before, and failing as the next one surely will. </p><p> Problems that have no meaning cannot be resolved within the framework they     are set. Two selves in conflict could not be resolved, and good and evil     have no meeting place. The self you made can never be your Self, nor can     your Self be split in two, and still be what It is and must forever be.     A mind and body cannot both exist. Make no attempt to reconcile the two,     for one denies the other can be real. If you are physical, your mind is     gone from your self-concept, for it has no place in which it could be really     part of you. If you are spirit, then the body must be meaningless to your     reality. </p><p> Spirit makes use of mind as means to find its Self expression. And the mind     which serves the spirit is at peace and filled with joy. Its power comes     from spirit, and it is fulfilling happily its function here. Yet mind can     also see itself divorced from spirit, and perceive itself within a body     it confuses with itself. Without its function then it has no peace, and     happiness is alien to its thoughts. </p><p> Yet mind apart from spirit cannot think. It has denied its Source of strength,     and sees itself as helpless, limited and weak. Dissociated from its function     now, it thinks it is alone and separate, attacked by armies massed against     itself and hiding in the body's frail support. Now must it reconcile unlike     with like, for this is what it thinks that it is for. </p><p> Waste no more time on this. Who can resolve the senseless conflicts which     a dream presents? What could the resolution mean in truth? What purpose     could it serve? What is it for? Salvation cannot make illusions real, nor     solve a problem that does not exist. Perhaps you hope it can. Yet would     you have God's plan for the release of His dear Son bring pain to him, and     fail to set him free? </p><p> Your Self retains Its Thoughts, and they remain within your mind and in the     Mind of God. The Holy Spirit holds salvation in your mind, and offers it     the way to peace. Salvation is a thought you share with God, because His     Voice accepted it for you and answered in your name that it was done. Thus     is salvation kept among the Thoughts your Self holds dear and cherishes     for you. </p><p> We will attempt today to find this thought, whose presence in your mind is     guaranteed by Him Who speaks to you from your one Self. Our hourly five-minute     practicing will be a search for Him within your mind. Salvation comes from     this one Self through Him Who is the Bridge between your mind and It. Wait     patiently, and let Him speak to you about your Self, and what your mind     can do, restored to It and free to serve Its Will. </p><p> Begin with saying this: </p>     <p><i>Salvation comes from my one Self. Its Thoughts are mine to use. </i></p><p>Then seek Its Thoughts, and claim them as your own. These are your own real     thoughts you have denied, and let your mind go wandering in a world of dreams,     to find illusions in their place. Here are your thoughts, the only ones     you have. Salvation is among them; find it there. </p><p> If you succeed, the thoughts that come to you will tell you you are saved,     and that your mind has found the function that it sought to lose. Your Self     will welcome it and give it peace. Restored in strength, it will again flow     out from spirit to the spirit in all things created by the Spirit as Itself.     Your mind will bless all things. Confusion done, you are restored, for you     have found your Self. </p><p> Your Self knows that you cannot fail today. Perhaps your mind remains uncertain     yet a little while. Be not dismayed by this. The joy your Self experiences     It will save for you, and it will yet be yours in full awareness. Every     time you spend five minutes of the hour seeking Him Who joins your mind     and Self, you offer Him another treasure to be kept for you. </p><p> Each time today you tell your frantic mind salvation comes from your one     Self, you lay another treasure in your growing store. And all of it is given     everyone who asks for it, and will accept the gift. Think, then, how much     is given unto you to give this day, that it be given you! </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
