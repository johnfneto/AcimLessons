It accepts no split identity,     nor tries to weave opposing factors into unity. It simply states the truth.     Practice this truth today as often as you can, for it will bring your mind     from conflict to the quiet fields of peace. No chill of fear can enter,     for your mind has been absolved from madness, letting go illusions of a     split identity. </p><p> We state again the truth about your Self, the holy Son of God Who rests in     you; whose mind has been restored to sanity. You are the spirit lovingly     endowed with all your Father's Love and peace and joy. You are the spirit     which completes Himself, and shares His function as Creator. He is with     you always, as you are with Him. </p><p> Today we try to bring reality still closer to your mind. Each time you practice,     awareness is brought a little nearer at least; sometimes a thousand years     or more are saved. The minutes which you give are multiplied over and over,     for the miracle makes use of time, but is not ruled by it. Salvation is     a miracle, the first and last; the first that is the last, for it is one. </p><p> You are the spirit in whose mind abides the miracle in which all time stands     still; the miracle in which a minute spent in using these ideas becomes     a time that has no limit and that has no end. Give, then, these minutes     willingly, and count on Him Who promised to lay timelessness beside them.     He will offer all His strength to every little effort that you make. Give     Him the minutes which He needs today, to help you understand with Him you     are the spirit that abides in Him, and that calls through His Voice to every     living thing; offers His sight to everyone who asks; replaces error with     the simple truth. </p><p> The Holy Spirit will be glad to take five minutes of each hour from your     hands, and carry them around this aching world where pain and misery appear     to rule. He will not overlook one open mind that will accept the healing     gifts they bring, and He will lay them everywhere He knows they will be     welcome. And they will increase in healing power each time someone accepts     them as his thoughts, and uses them to heal. </p><p> Thus will each gift to Him be multiplied a thousandfold and tens of thousands     more. And when it is returned to you, it will surpass in might the little     gift you gave as much as does the radiance of the sun outshine the tiny     gleam a firefly makes an uncertain moment and goes out. The steady brilliance     of this light remains and leads you out of darkness, nor will you be able     to forget the way again. </p><p> Begin these happy exercises with the words the Holy Spirit speaks to you,     and let them echo round the world through Him: </p>     <p><i>Spirit am I, a holy Son of God, free of all limits, safe and           healed and whole,          free to forgive, and free to save the world. </i></p><p>Expressed through you, the Holy Spirit will accept this gift that you received     of Him, increase its power and give it back to you. </p><p> Offer each practice period today gladly to Him. And He will speak to you,     reminding you that you are spirit, one with Him and God, your brothers and     your Self. Listen for His assurance every time you speak the words He offers     you today, and let Him tell your mind that they are true. Use them against     temptation, and escape its sorry consequences if you yield to the belief     that you are something else. The Holy Spirit gives you peace today. Receive     His words, and offer them to Him. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
