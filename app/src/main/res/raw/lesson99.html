They both imply that something has     gone wrong; something to be saved from, forgiven for; something amiss that     needs corrective change; something apart or different from the Will of God.     Thus do both terms imply a thing impossible but yet which has occurred,     resulting in a state of conflict seen between what is and what could never     be. </p><p> Truth and illusions both are equal now, for both have happened. The impossible     becomes the thing you need forgiveness for, salvation from. Salvation now     becomes the borderland between the truth and the illusion. It reflects the     truth because it is the means by which you can escape illusions. Yet it     is not yet the truth because it undoes what was never done. </p><p> How could there be a meeting place at all where earth and Heaven can be reconciled     within a mind where both of them exist? The mind that sees illusions thinks     them real. They have existence in that they are thoughts. And yet they are     not real, because the mind that thinks these thoughts is separate from God. </p><p> What joins the separated mind and thoughts with Mind and Thought which are     forever One? What plan could hold the truth inviolate, yet recognize the     need illusions bring, and offer means by which they are undone without attack     and with no touch of pain? What but a Thought of God could be this plan,     by which the never done is overlooked, and sins forgotten which were never     real? </p><p> The Holy Spirit holds this plan of God exactly as it was received of Him     within the Mind of God and in your own. It is apart from time in that its     Source is timeless. Yet it operates in time, because of your belief that     time is real. Unshaken does the Holy Spirit look on what you see; on sin     and pain and death, on grief and separation and on loss. Yet does He know     one thing must still be true; God is still Love, and this is not His Will. </p><p> This is the Thought that brings illusions to the truth, and sees them as     appearances behind which is the changeless and the sure. This is the Thought     that saves and that forgives, because it lays no faith in what is not created     by the only Source it knows. This is the Thought whose function is to save     by giving you its function as your own. Salvation is your function, with     the One to Whom the plan was given. Now are you entrusted with this plan,     along with Him. He has one answer to appearances; regardless of their form,     their size, their depth or any attribute they seem to have: </p>     <p><i>Salvation is my only function here. <br />          God still is Love, and this is not His          Will. </i></p><p> You who will yet work miracles, be sure you practice well the idea for today.     Try to perceive the strength in what you say, for these are words in which     your freedom lies. Your Father loves you. All the world of pain is not His     Will. Forgive yourself the thought He wanted this for you. Then let the     Thought with which He has replaced all your mistakes enter the darkened     places of your mind that thought the thoughts that never were His Will. </p><p> This part belongs to God, as does the rest. It does not think its solitary     thoughts, and make them real by hiding them from Him. Let in the light,     and you will look upon no obstacle to what He wills for you. Open your secrets     to His kindly light, and see how bright this light still shines in you. </p><p> Practice His Thought today, and let His light seek out and lighten up all     darkened spots, and shine through them to join them to the rest. It is God's     Will your mind be one with His. It is God's Will that He has but one Son.     It is God's Will that His one Son is you. Think of these things in practicing     today, and start the lesson that we learn today with this instruction in     the way of truth: </p>     <p><i>Salvation is my only function here.<br />     </i><i>Salvation and forgiveness are the same. </i></p><p>Then turn to Him Who shares your function here, and let Him teach you what     you need to learn to lay all fear aside, and know your Self as Love which     has no opposite in you. </p><p> Forgive all thoughts which would oppose the truth of your completion, unity     and peace. You cannot lose the gifts your Father gave. You do not want to     be another self. You have no function that is not of God. Forgive yourself     the one you think you made. Forgiveness and salvation are the same. Forgive     what you have made and you are saved. </p><p> There is a special message for today which has the power to remove all forms     of doubt and fear forever from your mind. If you are tempted to believe     them true, remember that appearances can not withstand the truth these mighty     words contain: </p>     <p><i>Salvation is my only function here.<br />     </i><i>God still is Love, and this is not His Will. </i></p><p> Your only function tells you you are one. Remind yourself of this between     the times you give five minutes to be shared with Him Who shares God's plan     with you. Remind yourself: </p>     <p><i>Salvation is my only function here. </i></p><p>Thus do you lay forgiveness on your mind and let all fear be gently laid aside,     that love may find its rightful place in you and show you that you are the     Son of God. </p><p> </p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
