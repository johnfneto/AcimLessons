        <item>A happy outcome to all things is sure</item>
        <item>All fear is past, and only love is here</item>
        <item>My body is a wholly neutral thing</item>

        <item>I judge all things as I would have them be</item>
        <item>I see all things as I would have them be</item>
        <item>Now let a new perception come to me</item>
        <item>I seek a future different from the past</item>
        <item>All gifts my brothers give belong to me</item>
        <item>All gifts I give my brothers are my own</item>
        <item>I follow in the way appointed me</item>
        <item>In me salvation\'s means and end are one</item>
        <item>I came for the salvation of the world</item>
        <item>My Father gives all power unto me</item>
        <item>Father, my freedom is in You alone</item>
        <item>I can give up but what was never real</item>
        <item>I gladly make the \'sacrifice\' of fear</item>
        <item>I merely follow, for I would not lead</item>
        <item>All things I think I see reflect ideas</item>
        <item>I am forever an Effect of God</item>
        <item>I need but call and You will answer me</item>
        <item>I choose the second place to gain the first</item>
        <item>I have already chosen what You will</item>
        <item>I will not hurt myself again today</item>
        <item>There is no conflict, for my will is Yours</item>
        <item>Fear binds the world. Forgiveness sets it free</item>
        <item>Forgiveness ends the dream of conflict here</item>
        <item>Today I claim the gifts forgiveness gives</item>
        <item>I choose to see my brother\'s sinlessness</item>
        <item>Forgiveness lets me know that minds are joined</item>
        <item>My sinlessness protects me from all harm</item>
        <item>I am affected only by my thoughts</item>
        <item>I will receive whatever I request</item>
        <item>I can be free of suffering today</item>
        <item>I can attack but my own sinlessness, And it is only that which keeps me safe.</item>
        <item>I let forgiveness rest upon all things, For thus forgiveness will be given me.</item>
        <item>I am not asked to make a sacrifice To find the mercy and the peace of God.</item>
        <item>Today I learn the law of love; that what I give my brother is my gift to me.</item>
        <item>I offer only miracles today, For I would have them be returned to me.</item>
        <item>Today the peace of God envelops me, And I forget all things except His Love.</item>
        <item>Anger must come from judgment. Judgment is The weapon I would use against myself, To keep the miracle away from me.</item>
        <item>I have no cause for anger or for fear, For You surround me. And in every need That I perceive, Your grace suffices me.</item>
        <item>Today I let Christ\'s vision look upon All things for me and judge them not, but give Each one a miracle of love instead.</item>
        <item>Miracles mirror God\'s eternal Love. To offer them is to remember Him, And through His memory to save the world.</item>
        <item>My sinless brother is my guide to peace. My sinful brother is my guide to pain. And which I choose to see I will behold.</item>
        <item>Judgment and love are opposites. From one Come all the sorrows of the world. But from The other comes the peace of God Himself.</item>
        <item>My eyes, my tongue, my hands, my feet today Have but one purpose; to be given Christ To use to bless the world with miracles.</item>
        <item>We stand together, Christ and I, in peace And certainty of purpose. And in Him Is His Creator, as He is in me.</item>
        <item>There is no end to all the peace and joy, And all the miracles that I will give, When I accept God\'s Word. Why not today?</item>
        <item>Sickness is but another name for sin. Healing is but another name for God. The miracle is thus a call to Him.</item>
        <item>Truth answers every call we make to God, Responding first with miracles, and then Returning unto us to be itself.</item>
        <item>No call to God can be unheard nor left Unanswered. And of this I can be sure; His answer is the one I really want.</item>
        <item>God\'s answer is some form of peace. All pain Is healed; all misery replaced with joy. All prison doors are opened. And all sin Is understood as merely a mistake.</item>
        <item>Peace be to me, the holy Son of God. Peace to my brother, who is one with me. Let all the world be blessed with peace through us.</item>

        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. Pain is my own idea. It is not a Thought of God, but one I thought apart from Him and from His Will. His Will is joy, and only joy for His beloved Son. And that I choose, instead of what I made. \nI am not a body.

        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. A lesson is a miracle which God offers to me, in place of thoughts I made that hurt me. What I learn of Him becomes the way I am set free. And so I choose to learn His lessons and forget my own. \nI am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.</item>
        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. The past is gone; the future is not yet. Now am I freed from both. For what God gives can only be for good. And I accept but what He gives as what belongs to me. \nI am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.</item>
        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. The Holy Spirit is my only Guide. He walks with me in love. And I give thanks to Him for showing me the way to go. \nI am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.</item>
        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. All that I do I do unto myself. If I attack, I suffer. But if I forgive, salvation will be given me. \nI am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.</item>
        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. Who should give thanks for my salvation but myself?

        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n.

For I am still as God created me.</item>
        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. I am God\'s Son. Be still, my mind, and think a moment upon this. And then return to earth, without confusion as to what my Father loves forever as His Son. \nI am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.</item>
        <item>I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me. No one but is my brother.\n. Let me not wander from the way of peace, for I am lost on other roads than this. 3 But let me follow Him Who leads me home, and peace is certain as the Love of God. \nI am not a body. I am free.

        <item>My Father gives all power unto me</item>
        <item>Father, my freedom is in You alone</item>
        <item>I can give up but what was never real</item>
        <item>I gladly make the \'sacrifice\' of fear</item>
        <item>I merely follow, for I would not lead</item>
        <item>All things I think I see reflect ideas</item>
        <item>I am forever an Effect of God</item>
        <item>I need but call and You will answer me</item>
        <item>I choose the second place to gain the first</item>
        <item>I have already chosen what You will</item>
        <item>I will not hurt myself again today</item>
        <item>There is no conflict, for my will is Yours</item>
        <item>Fear binds the world. Forgiveness sets it free</item>
        <item>Forgiveness ends the dream of conflict here</item>
        <item>Today I claim the gifts forgiveness gives</item>
        <item>I choose to see my brother\'s sinlessness</item>
        <item>Forgiveness lets me know that minds are joined</item>
        <item>My sinlessness protects me from all harm</item>
        <item>I am affected only by my thoughts</item>
        <item>I will receive whatever I request</item>
        <item>I can be free of suffering today</item>
        <item>I can attack but my own sinlessness, And it is only that which keeps me safe.</item>
        <item>I let forgiveness rest upon all things, For thus forgiveness will be given me.</item>
        <item>I am not asked to make a sacrifice To find the mercy and the peace of God.</item>
        <item>Today I learn the law of love; that what I give my brother is my gift to me.</item>
        <item>I offer only miracles today, For I would have them be returned to me.</item>
        <item>Today the peace of God envelops me, And I forget all things except His Love.</item>
        <item>Anger must come from judgment. Judgment is The weapon I would use against myself, To keep the miracle away from me.</item>
        <item>I have no cause for anger or for fear, For You surround me. And in every need That I perceive, Your grace suffices me.</item>
        <item>Today I let Christ\'s vision look upon All things for me and judge them not, but give Each one a miracle of love instead.</item>
        <item>Miracles mirror God\'s eternal Love. To offer them is to remember Him, And through His memory to save the world.</item>
        <item>My sinless brother is my guide to peace. My sinful brother is my guide to pain. And which I choose to see I will behold.</item>
        <item>Judgment and love are opposites. From one Come all the sorrows of the world. But from The other comes the peace of God Himself.</item>
        <item>My eyes, my tongue, my hands, my feet today Have but one purpose; to be given Christ To use to bless the world with miracles.</item>
        <item>We stand together, Christ and I, in peace And certainty of purpose. And in Him Is His Creator, as He is in me.</item>
        <item>There is no end to all the peace and joy, And all the miracles that I will give, When I accept God\'s Word. Why not today?</item>
        <item>Sickness is but another name for sin. Healing is but another name for God. The miracle is thus a call to Him.</item>
        <item>Truth answers every call we make to God, Responding first with miracles, and then Returning unto us to be itself.</item>
        <item>No call to God can be unheard nor left Unanswered. And of this I can be sure; His answer is the one I really want.</item>
        <item>God\'s answer is some form of peace. All pain Is healed; all misery replaced with joy. All prison doors are opened. And all sin Is understood as merely a mistake.</item>
        <item>Peace be to me, the holy Son of God. Peace to my brother, who is one with me. Let all the world be blessed with peace through us.</item>
        <item>This holy instant would I give to you.  Be You in charge.  For I would follow you, Certain that Your direction gives me peace.</item>
        <item>This holy instant would I give to you.  Be You in charge.  For I would follow you, Certain that Your direction gives me peace.</item>
